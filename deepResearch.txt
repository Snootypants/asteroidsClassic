To move forward with your request, I need to clarify a few things:

You mentioned having a PNG for the ship—do you want help with integrating that now, or should that be staged for a later pass?

For improving the asteroids, should I prioritize shader-based solutions (WebGL/Canvas), image-based textures, or a mix?

Should I research upgrade paths and roguelite mechanics specific to space shooters, or general roguelites?

For UI/UX, do you want reference games, visual style direction, or both?

For the QA/hygiene pass, should I focus only on the existing GitHub repo (Snootypants/asteroidsClassic), or are there other sources/codebases I should include?

Let me know so I can proceed precisely.

Understood. I’ll start by:

Evaluating how best to integrate PNG assets like your ship into the game loop and rendering pipeline.

Exploring how other developers enhance asteroid visuals, including shader tricks, animated textures, and 3D-illusion techniques.

Researching roguelite upgrade and progression systems—focusing on both permanent hangar-style upgrades and in-run random upgrades.

Looking into in-game currency systems: how they’re collected, used, and balanced.

Reviewing UI/UX patterns for space shooter and roguelite games, focusing on effective layout, feedback, and aesthetics.

Running a deep QA and hygiene review of the Snootypants/asteroidsClassic repo, flagging inefficiencies, hardcoding, and architectural concerns with proposed fixes.

I’ll get back to you with a comprehensive breakdown across these categories.

Game Design and QA Audit for AsteroidsClassic

Incorporating PNG Assets into Your Asteroids Classic Game
PNG vs Other Image Formats for Game Sprites
Using PNG files for your game’s sprites and assets is both common and advisable. PNG images support lossless compression and transparency, making them ideal for 2D game graphics like ships, asteroids, and UI elements. In fact, game developers typically choose PNG for sprite artwork (especially those with flat colors or pixel-art style) and only use formats like JPEG for large, detailed backgrounds
gamedev.stackexchange.com
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. The original 1979 Asteroids used wireframe vector graphics instead of any bitmapped sprites
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
, but modern recreations almost always use raster images (sprites) on pixel-based displays. In short, your PNG assets are absolutely usable – they’ll provide the visual detail and style you want, while keeping image quality high (no compression artifacts) and allowing transparent backgrounds for irregular shapes. One thing to keep in mind is that once loaded into memory, all image formats occupy roughly the same space (each pixel is typically stored in RGBA format). The difference between PNG, JPEG, etc. mainly affects file size and loading time, not runtime performance
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. So, you don’t need to convert PNGs to another format for performance – just ensure your PNG files are reasonably optimized (you can compress them without quality loss using tools like TinyPNG, for example). Also note that memory usage scales with image resolution, so avoid using an excessively high resolution PNG if you’ll be drawing it scaled down. It’s often best to size your assets to the max resolution they’ll appear on screen to save memory, or have multiple sizes if targeting different screen densities.
Integrating PNG Graphics: Options and Best Practices
With your PNG art ready, the next step is integrating those images into the game. Since you’ve wisely separated the art into its own branch, you can merge them once the game logic is ready without disrupting development – a practice many studios follow to let programming and art progress in parallel
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. Here are some strategies and best practices for using the PNG assets:
Pre-load Your Images: Ensure all your PNG assets are loaded before the game action starts. In an HTML5 canvas context (which your Asteroids Classic likely uses), this means creating Image objects for each asset, setting their .src, and waiting for their onload event before entering the main game loop
rembound.com
rembound.com
. Preloading prevents gameplay from pausing later when an image is first drawn. Many developers implement a simple loading screen or progress counter while assets load
rembound.com
. This way, by the time the player sees the start screen or clicks “Start”, all your sprite images (ship, asteroids, explosions, UI, etc.) are ready in memory.
Drawing and Transforming Images: Once loaded, rendering a PNG on the canvas is straightforward with context.drawImage(). You can draw the full image or specify source rectangles if you’re using spritesheets (more on that shortly)
rembound.com
. If you need to rotate or scale sprites (e.g. rotating the ship or asteroids), you have a couple of options:
Canvas transforms: Save the canvas context, use ctx.translate() and ctx.rotate() to orient, then draw the image, and restore the context. This lets you rotate the PNG sprite around a pivot (usually its center) before drawing. It’s simple but does the math each frame.
Pre-rotated sprites: For something like an asteroid that might rotate continuously, some games generate pre-rotated images (or have multiple frames) so that drawing doesn’t require real-time rotation. However, given modern hardware and the simplicity of Asteroids, using canvas rotation is usually fine unless you have dozens of large sprites rotating simultaneously.
Sprite sheets for animation: If any entity has multiple animation frames (for example, an animated explosion or a flickering thruster), it’s often convenient to pack those frames into a single PNG sheet and draw sub-rectangles. This keeps related frames in one file and can reduce the number of image files your game loads.
Sprite Sheets vs Individual Images: Many developers combine small images into larger sprite sheets (atlases) to optimize performance. Using a few large images instead of many small ones can speed up load times and rendering by reducing file requests and enabling sprite batching
codeandweb.com
. In practice, this means you might take all your asteroid pieces, ship frames, and pickups and pack them into one or two PNG files, along with a JSON specifying the coordinates of each sprite. The benefit is fewer draw calls or context state changes, since the game can draw many sprites from the same atlas in one go
codeandweb.com
. However, for a project of this scope, sprite sheets are an optimization, not a necessity – if you only have a handful of PNG assets, loading a dozen separate files is usually fine. As your game grows (e.g. more UI elements, power-up icons, multiple enemy types), consider using an atlas to keep things efficient.
Asset Organization and Loading Pipeline: Organize your PNG files in a clear structure (it looks like you have an assets/ folder already, which is great). Many games use subfolders (e.g. assets/sprites/, assets/ui/, assets/backgrounds/) to keep things tidy. If you’re using a build tool like Vite (as mentioned in a related Asteroids project) or bundler, take advantage of that by importing images or ensuring the assets folder is served correctly. Also, watch out for caching and path issues – during development, an image might seem to not update if the browser cached it, so a cache-busting trick (renaming or proper HTTP headers) can help when you replace assets.
Transparency and Color Formats: Since PNG supports full alpha transparency, you can have nicely anti-aliased edges on your asteroids and ship that blend with the background. Just make sure when exporting art that the alpha channel is preserved (e.g. no unintended opaque backgrounds). In-game, the canvas will render the transparent parts correctly over space. If you have any semi-transparent effects (like a thrust glow or particle), PNG can handle that too. In contrast, formats like BMP or older GIF either don’t support alpha or are paletted – which is why PNG is the de-facto choice for 2D game art today

How Other Games Handle Art Assets
Your approach of focusing on gameplay first and handling art separately is very much in line with industry best practices. Many developers use placeholder graphics or simple shapes during coding, then swap in final art when it’s ready – this decouples programming and art schedules so neither blocks the other
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. For example, early versions of levels in some games use simple colored blocks or wireframes (like the famous all-orange textures in Half-Life 2’s prototype levels) to test gameplay before artwork is finished
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. In your case, using basic shapes for the ship/asteroids while perfecting movement and collision was wise. Now you can drop in the PNG sprites with minimal code changes, because your game logic (physics, collision, wrapping, etc.) doesn’t depend on how the objects look. When it comes to branching and integration, some teams do exactly what you’re doing: keep art asset changes on a separate Git branch until they’re reviewed or until a milestone, then merge into the main line. This avoids cluttering the main development branch with large binary assets and allows easy reversion if an artist is experimenting. In bigger studios, artists might even commit to a separate branch that auto-merges after passing tests
randompoison.github.io
, but on a small project, a manual merge when ready is fine. The key point is that there’s no issue using PNGs directly in the codebase – just ensure your version control is handling them (Git LFS is sometimes used for very large binary files, but small PNGs can be committed normally). Other games similar to yours (Asteroids clones or retro-style shooters) typically handle assets in a few possible ways:
Vector Graphics: A few clones stick to vector-drawn shapes (programmatically drawing lines/polygons each frame) to mimic the authentic arcade look
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
. This has the advantage of resolution independence and a certain charm, but it limits you to a monochrome line-art style. Since you have full-color PNG artwork, you’re opting for a more modern sprite aesthetic – which is perfectly fine and very common.
Sprite Reuse and Variation: Games often reuse the same sprite for multiple purposes or create variations to add interest. For example, you might have a few different asteroid images so they don’t all look identical. You could achieve this either by having multiple PNG files or by having one spritesheet containing several asteroid variations. Some clones even generate asteroid shapes procedurally (random polygons) for endless variety, but that’s an advanced technique. Using hand-drawn PNGs will give your game a distinct visual style, especially if you have variations (which it sounds like you might, given talk of an “art branch” – maybe different asteroid designs or a more detailed ship).
UI and Backgrounds: Many games use PNGs for UI overlays (lives icons, score panels, buttons) and sometimes for background images. If your game has a starfield background or static backdrop, a JPEG could be used there if it’s a complex photo-like image; but often a tiled PNG or even procedurally drawn starfield is used. The commits you have (mentioning start_screen.png and gameEnd.png) show you’re using PNGs for full-screen graphics as well, which is fine. Just ensure they are sized appropriately for your canvas resolution to avoid scaling blurriness or slow load times. You can always downscale large images if needed.
Audio/Other Assets: (Though your question is about PNGs, a quick note: similarly, games handle audio and other assets by preloading and using appropriate formats. Since art is your focus now, make sure to also have a plan for preloading sounds when you add them, so the first gunshot or explosion doesn’t stutter due to lazy loading.)
Ensuring a Solid Base for Expansion
It’s great that you’re evaluating the codebase now that core gameplay is in place. A solid foundation will make it much easier to build on new features (and integrate art smoothly). From a high-level perspective, here are some recommendations to check against your Asteroids Classic codebase:
Separation of Concerns (Logic vs Rendering): Ideally, your game objects (ship, asteroids, bullets, etc.) should have their game logic (position, velocity, collision detection) separated from the rendering code. If, for example, you currently have a method like Asteroid.draw(ctx) that draws a polygon, you can modify it to draw an image instead – as long as the rest of the game doesn’t care how the asteroid is drawn. It sounds like you are indeed separating them (art branch vs game branch implies rendering can be swapped out without rewriting game mechanics). Continue to keep rendering code modular. For instance, you could give each object a property for its sprite image, or an enum for its appearance type (so a game object might choose between “draw polygon” or “draw image” based on what’s set). This way, toggling between placeholder art and final art is easy.
Game Loop and Timing: Make sure your base handles the game loop consistently (using requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps rendering, and maybe a fixed-step or delta timing for physics). A solid game loop will ensure that adding more assets or even more entities won’t break the feel of the game. If your game logic is frame-rate dependent, consider refactoring to use time deltas so it runs the same on slower or faster machines. This isn’t directly related to PNG assets, but it’s a “solid base” concern that pays off as the project grows.
Scalability of Asset Management: Right now, you might load images by hardcoding file paths in an array or in code. As the project grows, consider maintaining an asset manifest or loader utility. For example, an object or JSON that lists all assets with keys, so you can load them in one place and easily reference them by name throughout your code. This avoids sprinkling image paths or loading logic all over. It’s not required for a small game, but it’s a good practice if you plan to expand features (you mentioned things like currency pickups, hangar shop, etc., which means more graphics and possibly an inventory of assets).
Memory and Performance Checks: After integrating the PNG art, test how the game runs on target platforms (in a browser, maybe on both desktop and mobile if applicable). Ensure that adding graphics hasn’t introduced any lag. With canvas games, a common performance killer is accidentally redrawing too large an area or too many objects per frame. If you see slowdowns, tools like the browser dev timeline can show if rendering is the bottleneck. Often, using images doesn’t slow things down significantly for a game of this size, but if, say, you fill the screen with dozens of large PNGs with alpha effects, you might need to tune it (e.g., limiting the size of particles or turning off alpha on expensive operations). The good news is that drawing a small image is often faster than drawing an equivalent complex vector shape via code, because the image blitting is usually GPU-accelerated. So moving from vector-drawn asteroids to PNG sprites should not harm performance and might even improve it, as long as you’re not drastically increasing the number of objects.
Future-Proofing and Refactoring: Since you also have an AsteroidV2 refactoring in progress (with a React/TypeScript angle, as I gleaned), you’re already taking steps to improve the architecture. TypeScript can catch a lot of bugs early and help structure your entities with clear types/interfaces – a plus for maintainability. If your base “classic” code was getting messy, the refactor is likely making it cleaner (e.g. splitting code into modules, maybe separating game state management from rendering, etc.). It’s worth verifying that in the new structure, things like game state (score, lives, current level) and game entities are managed in a way that isn’t tightly coupled to the DOM or canvas. For example, in a React shell you might handle UI in React but game in a canvas element; make sure to keep those concerns isolated.
Testing and Debugging Tools: A solid base is one you can easily test and debug. Consider building little debug aids: for instance, a toggle to switch between placeholder shapes and the new PNG sprites for comparison, or a bounding-box overlay to ensure collisions still align with the new graphics. If your asteroid PNGs are larger or differently shaped than the old placeholders, you may need to adjust collision radii. A quick debug draw of collision circles can help fine-tune that. These kinds of tools make it easier to expand and ensure everything remains balanced.
Finally, assess if the current feature set meets your goals or if introducing a game framework would help going forward. Since you have a working base, it’s usually best to continue building on it rather than rewriting everything in a new engine, unless you have specific needs (e.g., physics engine, advanced audio, or cross-platform publishing) that the current vanilla approach can’t handle. Many classic arcade clones are successfully built with plain JavaScript/TypeScript and canvas, so you’re on the right track. The base you have is worth building on as long as it’s organized. If you find any part of the code becoming a bottleneck (for example, difficulty managing game states or adding new object types), that might be a cue to refactor that portion (or see how other open-source Asteroids clones structured it). But given what you’ve done so far, you should be in a good position to proceed. In summary, PNG assets are a great choice for your game and widely used by other developers for similar purposes. Integrate them by preloading and drawing with proper techniques, and consider sprite sheets if you have many assets. Other games handle art by separating it from core logic (often using placeholders first, just like you did) and by using atlases or optimized formats when needed. Continue to keep your code modular and your game loop tight, and your Asteroids Classic codebase will be a solid foundation to build upon for new features and polish. With a strong base, you can confidently add all the cool stuff (enhanced graphics, effects, UI, and beyond) knowing the underlying game will support it. Good luck, and happy coding! Sources:

AsteroidsClassic Visual Upgrade, Game Design, and QA Pass

Graphics and Visual Enhancements
Ship Sprite Integration: Replacing the player’s ship with a PNG sprite is straightforward now that an asset pipeline is set up. The public/assets/ directory can hold the ship image (e.g. assets/ship/ship1.png), and the game can load it via an <img> tag or by drawing it to the canvas
GitHub
. Ensure the sprite’s dimensions and orientation match the game’s expectations (e.g. ship pointing up if the game assumes that). Once integrated, remove any old vector-drawing code for the ship and adjust collision bounds to the sprite’s size. This provides an immediate visual upgrade without altering gameplay. Textured & Detailed Asteroids: Currently asteroids are drawn as white-outlined polygons
GitHub
GitHub
. To make them more detailed and 3D-looking, consider filling those polygon shapes with a stone texture. In HTML5 Canvas, you can create an Image object (e.g. a rocky pattern) and use ctx.createPattern(image, "repeat") to make a fill style
stackoverflow.com
. Then draw the asteroid polygon and call ctx.fill() instead of (or in addition to) ctx.stroke. The texture will fill the shape, and because the canvas context is rotated each frame by the asteroid’s angle
GitHub
GitHub
, the texture will rotate with it, simulating a spinning surface. This approach keeps asteroids procedurally generated (for irregular outlines) but with a consistent rocky appearance. You might still draw a subtle outline or drop the outline for a fully filled look. Adjust the texture’s brightness or color to match the game’s style (e.g. gray rock with slight shading). The result should be asteroids that look less like wireframes and more like solid rocks. Technical tip: ensure the texture image is loaded and ready before drawing; you can initialize the pattern once and reuse it for all asteroids for efficiency. Enhanced Starfield Background: The current starfield is already dense (~2000 stars) with parallax layers and varied brightness
GitHub
. To push it further, you could add twinkling stars or subtle color variation. A simple method is to randomly vary each star’s brightness slightly during each draw cycle
excessivelyadequate.com
, giving a twinkle effect. You can implement this by drawing stars with an alpha that oscillates or with occasional flicker on a random subset of stars. Another enhancement is to include color variety based on star distance – for example, distant stars tinted blue and nearer stars warm white
godotshaders.com
. This mimics how stars can appear different (blue giants vs red dwarfs) and adds depth. Since you already use parallax for depth, you can assign a color or size to each star layer (e.g. far layer stars are smaller and bluish, close layer stars larger and white). The parallax layering can also be increased to 3+ layers, perhaps with an extra layer of a few large, very distant stars that move very slowly
godotshaders.com
. Finally, consider occasional special effects: for instance, a rare “shooting star” streak or a faint nebula cloud in the background. These should be used sparingly to avoid distraction, but can add that “wow” factor. Overall, the goal is to keep the background lively yet not overpowering – small twinkles and color shifts can make the starfield feel more dynamic without drawing attention away from the gameplay.
Upgrade Systems and Game Balance
Upgrade Paths for Wave vs Survival Modes: Designing upgrade systems for the two modes might require different approaches. In Wave Mode (discrete levels of enemies), you can implement a between-wave upgrade or shop. For example, after clearing a wave, present the player with a choice of upgrades or a store where they spend points/currency for enhancements before the next wave begins. This segmented approach lets players recover or retool between waves. In Survival Mode (endless play until death), the upgrades should occur during the run – often via a level-up system. As the player destroys enemies/asteroids, they accumulate XP and periodically “level up,” triggering an upgrade selection. A popular design (seen in Nova Drift and many roguelites) is to offer a choice of 3 random upgrades at each level-up, from which the player picks one. This was described in Nova Drift, an Asteroids-inspired roguelite where “you finish waves of enemies and level up and pick upgrades… then you do it again”
forum.quartertothree.com
. The random choice adds variety and replay value, ensuring each run yields different builds. Implementing this might involve pausing the action momentarily and showing an upgrade menu with 3 cards or icons for the player to choose from. Types of Upgrades & Balance: Start by brainstorming categories of upgrades. Common ones in space shooters include: weapon upgrades (spread shot, faster fire rate, missiles, lasers, etc.), defensive upgrades (shields, more lives or hull integrity, smaller hitbox), mobility upgrades (faster thrust, better handling), and miscellaneous abilities (e.g. periodic shockwaves, drones that assist in combat, etc.). You might also include upgrades that modify existing stats (fire rate, bullet speed, ship speed, damage, etc.). It’s wise to tier them: basic upgrades first, with more powerful or specialized ones appearing later or after certain prerequisites. For example, Nova Drift separates “Gear” (weapon/shield/body choices) from “Mods” (stackable enhancements) and unlocks the latter after a few levels
lordsofgaming.net
lordsofgaming.net
. You don’t need that same complexity initially, but it illustrates how players can first pick a major path (say, weapon type) and then later refine with smaller upgrades. Balancing Upgrade Progression: Balance is crucial so that the game remains challenging but fair. One strategy is to use an XP curve that increases per level – i.e., each new level requires more XP than the last. This prevents the player from leveling up too fast and stacking all upgrades early. As one player noted about a similar asteroids roguelite, if XP requirements don’t scale, “I was leveling up every few seconds once I had a few levels in”
reddit.com
, which made the game too easy. To avoid this, decide how many upgrades you expect a player to get in an average run and tune the XP curve to deliver that. Also scale enemy difficulty in parallel – e.g., each wave or each few levels, introduce tougher enemies or higher asteroid speeds so that upgrades are needed to survive. If Wave mode is meant to have a finite end (say 10 waves and a boss), ensure a player who reaches the end has roughly a full kit of upgrades but not an invincible juggernaut before the finale. In Survival (endless) mode, since the game will eventually overwhelm the player, you can be more generous with upgrades and see how long they last. Playtesting is key – simulate or log how quickly players gain XP and how effective each upgrade is. If one upgrade combo always trivializes the game, you may need to tone it down or increase difficulty accordingly. Roguelite Elements & Permanent Progression: To increase long-term engagement, you can add permanent upgrades or unlocks outside of a single run – e.g. a hangar or tech tree in the main menu. In this system, players earn some currency or points each run (tied to score, distance, or achievements) that persist after death. They can spend these to unlock new ship abilities, weapons, or slight stat boosts that apply to the start of future runs. This is a hallmark of roguelites: “Play, die, upgrade, and repeat” in a cycle
forum.quartertothree.com
. For example, you might let the player permanently increase their starting lives, or unlock entirely new ship types or starting weapons. Nova Drift does this by unlocking new upgrade options over time
forum.quartertothree.com
 – players noticed “upgrades available that weren’t available before” after successive runs, which keeps the game fresh. Another example is Rogue Legacy (a platformer), where gold from runs upgrades your character’s base stats for the next run; in a space shooter, this could be framed as ship improvements or new tech blueprints that persist. When implementing permanent upgrades, balance is again key: they should make the player stronger, but not so overpowered that eventually the game becomes trivial. One approach is diminishing returns (each upgrade costs more, or has smaller effect as it stacks) or introducing higher difficulty levels to tackle once players have many upgrades. In-Run Drops vs Post-Run Upgrades: You mentioned “nanobots that upgrade the ship given whatever options open up when leveling” – this is a flavorful way to explain the in-run upgrade mechanism (e.g. collect a power-up item that triggers the level-up choice). You can have asteroids sometimes drop these “nanobot” upgrade tokens or just have XP be an automatic accumulation. In addition, classic arcade design allows power-up drops: maybe certain destroyed asteroids or enemy UFOs drop temporary power-ups (like a damage boost, a shield recharge, or one-time items). These add moment-to-moment excitement and decision-making (do you risk going for the power-up?). Just be careful not to overwhelm the player with too many different systems; ensure the player can clearly understand when they leveled up and how to choose an upgrade, versus when a temporary pickup appears. Currency Implementation & Use: If you introduce a new currency (for permanent upgrades or for an in-game shop), decide what form it takes and how it’s earned. A common theme is to have ores or minerals drop from asteroids – for example, Space Miner (another Asteroids-like game) uses the concept of mining asteroid ore which converts to money: “Destroy asteroids, collect different minerals to improve your ship”
store.steampowered.com
. You could likewise assign a point value or currency value to each asteroid (perhaps based on size – larger asteroids drop more) and have the player collect it as floating resources. This currency can then be spent either between waves (at a shop or upgrade screen) or between runs (for permanent boosts, as discussed). To implement it, you’d add a currency counter to the HUD and increment it whenever the player collects a resource. Physically, you could spawn a pickup item that the ship must touch, or simply auto-collect to avoid extra hassle in a fast shooter. Balancing currency involves setting prices for upgrades appropriately. Start by determining how many runs or waves you expect a player to play to afford a meaningful upgrade. You want upgrades to feel rewarding and attainable, but not so cheap that the player unlocks everything in one hour. A typical model: early upgrades are cheap so the player gets a taste of progress, then costs ramp up exponentially for the strongest upgrades. Also consider multiple currencies: maybe one currency for the shop during runs (temporary money) and a separate one for permanent upgrades (e.g. “Upgrade Points” earned only on game over, proportional to score or furthest wave). This prevents the player from having to choose between short-term power (using currency now) and long-term progress – they can engage with both systems separately.
UI/UX and Art Direction
HUD and Interface Design: For a fast-paced space shooter, the HUD should be clear, minimal, and out of the action area. Key elements to display are the player’s lives, score, current level/wave, and perhaps shield/health status. Your current layout places score and lives to the side of the play area and a minimap to the right

 – that’s a good start, as it keeps central vision focused on gameplay. Moving forward, consider adding an XP bar and level indicator (since you’re adding leveling). In the recent update, a top-centered XP bar was added with a numeric readout
GitHub
GitHub
 – this is a good approach, as players can glance at progress towards the next upgrade. Visual hierarchy is important: the most critical info (maybe lives and health) should be the most prominent, whereas stats like score or wave number can be smaller or tucked in a corner. A UI/UX art director’s advice is to list everything you want on the HUD, rank it by importance, and design around those priorities
reddit.com
. In practice, that means maybe your Lives and Shield are larger icons or distinct colors, while the score is smaller text. Also avoid information overload – show only what the player needs at the moment
reddit.com
. For example, if you implement a temporary power-up, you might show an icon and duration only when active, then hide it when not. Keep the HUD lean so that it doesn’t clutter the screen or distract. Upgrade Selection UI: When the player levels up (in survival mode) or between waves, you’ll need a UI for choosing upgrades. Generally, it’s best to pause or slow the game during this to give players time to read choices. You can overlay a semi-transparent panel with 3 upgrade cards/buttons. Each should have a concise title, an icon if possible, and a short description. Maintain a consistent style for these panels – for instance, a futuristic tech border or a simple translucent black box – and use a readable font (sans-serif fonts are usually preferred for legibility in games
reddit.com
). Test the text size by actually viewing it in-game; players shouldn’t have to squint or read paragraphs mid-action. Tooltips or extended info can be available on hover or a “More info” key, but the basic effect should be clear (“+20% fire rate” or “Gain homing missiles”). Visual Style and Cohesion: It’s important that the ship, asteroids, background, and UI all feel like they belong to the same game. Right now you’re transitioning from pure vectors to raster images. Decide on an art direction: will it be retro neon (glowing outlines and particles), pixel art (chunky pixelated ship and asteroids for a classic feel), or a more modern painted look (textured asteroids, high-res ship sprite, etc.)? Each approach can work, but you should unify around one. For example, if the ship PNG is a sleek colored graphic, having asteroids textured similarly (instead of pure white lines) will match it better. Likewise, the starfield colors should complement the overall color scheme (e.g. if the game objects are mostly grayscale with bright highlights, the stars could remain white/blue; if you go neon, the stars might have neon purple/blue glows, etc.). The UI can either be diegetic (styled like in-world holograms) or simply functional. A clean, contrasty UI often works best: e.g. light text on a dark translucent background, or vice versa, so it’s readable at a glance. Use color coding in the UI sparingly but smartly – for instance, you might display lives or health in green (turning red when low), and use a consistent color for XP or currency. One player feedback point for a similar game was to use color to distinguish elements: “bad stuff in the red/orange range, good stuff in blue/green”
reddit.com
. That’s a good rule of thumb: enemy bullets/explosions could have a warm hue, whereas player projectiles or power-ups have cooler hues, so the player can instantly tell if an object is a threat or a reward. Approach to Developing Art Assets: If you’re not an artist, don’t worry – there are resources to help. You can find free or inexpensive asset packs for space games (for example, on sites like itch.io or OpenGameArt, there are asteroid and spaceship sprite packs
itch.io
opengameart.org
). Using consistent asset packs ensures everything has a unified style (same artist or method). Alternatively, you can generate or draw them yourself: asteroids can be made by sketching irregular shapes and applying a rock texture in an image editor, or even using procedural generation (there are tutorials for generating 2D asteroid sprites via code or noise). The ship sprite you have is a start; if you need more (like different ship models or enemy UFOs), try to use the same rendering style. Art direction also extends to effects – consider adding particle effects for explosions, thrust, etc., which add juice to the visuals. These particles (sparks, debris) should also match the style (for example, pixel-art particles if you go pixel art, or glow particles if you go neon). When in doubt, consistency and simplicity win – a cohesive simple style looks better than a mix of realistic and cartoon elements. As you design the UI, maintain consistency there too: use at most two fonts (one for headers and one for body text) and keep font styles uniform (e.g. don’t mix a fantasy font with a sci-fi font). The HUD panels and menus should use the same color palette and widget styles (same button shapes, corners, etc.), so it all feels like one interface.
Code Quality and Optimization
Eliminating Hard-Coded Values: In the earlier code audit, many “magic numbers” were refactored into constants (e.g. ship physics constants, world size, star counts)
GitHub
. Continue this practice for any new features. For instance, if you add an XP system, define constants for the XP needed at base level, or a growth rate, instead of embedding numbers in logic. This makes tweaking the balance much easier. Similarly, upgrade effects (like “+20% fire rate”) might be best stored in a configuration object or at least clearly commented, rather than just applied ad hoc in code. The improvements already made (e.g. using INITIAL_LIVES instead of a literal 3 in state) should be maintained
GitHub
GitHub
. Take a pass through the code to see if any numbers slipped through – for example, any UI layout dimensions or timeouts that are still literals. Turning those into named constants (perhaps in constants.js or a new constants-ui.js for interface-related numbers) will keep the project easy to adjust. Performance Considerations: The game is using React for UI and Canvas for rendering the game world. One notable improvement was throttling React state updates to only update when necessary
GitHub
. Right now, the game loop calls setUiState every frame with the latest score, lives, etc., but always spreading prev state
GitHub
. To truly minimize re-renders, you could check if the values actually changed before setting state. For instance, keep track of the last drawn score, and only call setUiState when scoreRef.current differs from the last value. Otherwise, React may still reconcile the virtual DOM every frame (even if the values are the same) because a new object is being produced. That said, since you’ve already reduced expensive computations, this is a micro-optimization; focus first on higher-level performance: ensure the canvas drawing code is efficient (use requestAnimationFrame as you do, avoid unnecessary canvas state changes like too many saves/restores, etc.). Also consider capping certain effects for performance – e.g. the starfield has 2000 stars; if you ever find it slows older devices, you could scale that down or canvas-draw the starfield once as a static background and only move a smaller set of nearby stars. Memory and Cleanup: Make sure that event listeners (keyboard, mouse) are properly removed when the component unmounts or when they’re no longer needed. For example, if you added a window resize listener for responsive layout, use useEffect cleanup to remove it. The pointer lock or mouse movement events should also be cleaned up on unmount. The game loop already cancels the animation frame on unmount
GitHub
, which is good. Watch out for any timers or intervals (perhaps in the new upgrade or spawn systems) – clear them on game over or unmount to prevent leaks or unwanted calls after the game ends. Robustness and Edge Cases: Do a fresh QA pass focusing on potential edge cases. For example, what happens when the player dies in Survival mode – does the game properly reset all necessary state (score, level, etc.) when starting a new run? The new code sets stats back to initial values on start
GitHub
, which is good. Verify that in both modes. Also, test the transition from menu -> game -> game over -> menu repeatedly to ensure there’s no accumulated state (e.g. lingering asteroids from a previous run). Another edge case: if the player reaches max level or if XP goes beyond xpMax, make sure it rolls over properly (e.g. subtract xpMax, increment level, and increase the next xpMax perhaps). If not yet implemented, add logic for leveling up: when xp >= xpMax, do xp -= xpMax; level += 1; xpMax *= growthFactor; (or whatever formula) and then trigger the upgrade selection UI. Planned Features Integration: As you add upgrades and currency, keep code quality in mind. It might be wise to refactor some logic out of App.jsx into dedicated modules. For example, you could have an UpgradeManager that handles the list of possible upgrades, applying an upgrade to the player ship, etc. This keeps the main game loop cleaner. Similarly, a Shop or Hangar module could manage permanent upgrades and store data (maybe in localStorage or a backend, if persistence is needed). Encapsulating these systems will prevent App.jsx from becoming too monolithic. Be Brutal – Any Remaining Issues: Finally, here are a few nitpicks to aim for perfection:
Restart Mode Consistency: Noticed in the UI patch that when the Game Over screen offers “Play Again”, it always starts wave mode
GitHub
. If the player was in Survival, you might want “Play Again” to respect that mode. It’s a small detail, but maintaining the chosen mode improves user experience.
Input Handling Efficiency: If you haven’t already, ensure that input checks (keys pressed, mouse movement) are done efficiently each frame or via events. Avoid heavy computations in those checks. Given the simple control scheme, this is likely fine.
Comments and Documentation: Continue to document any non-obvious code. For example, if using a formula for XP growth or a particular balancing decision, leave a comment (and perhaps a reference to where the idea came from, if applicable). This will help future you or collaborators understand the rationale.
Testing New Features: You have a nice test setup (Vitest) with some coverage on collision and limits
GitHub
. Consider writing a few tests for the upgrade logic (e.g. a test that simulates gaining XP and leveling up, ensuring the values reset correctly, and that choosing an upgrade applies the correct effect). Testing the game’s random aspects can be tricky, but you can structure the upgrade selection in a testable way (e.g. a function that given a list of upgrades and a random seed, returns 3 choices – then test that no matter what, it never picks an unavailable upgrade, etc.). This level of thoroughness catches bugs early.
Overall, the codebase has improved significantly in cleanliness and performance (as noted in the improvements doc: 20+ magic numbers removed, DRYed up duplicate code, and cut React re-renders dramatically
GitHub
GitHub
). By extending the same rigor to new features, you’ll keep the project maintainable. In summary, focus on clear separation of concerns (game logic vs UI vs data), use constants/config for tunable values, and test for edge cases. With these practices, the game will not only play great with the new upgrades, but the code underneath will be robust and easy to refine further – which is exactly what we want for a long-term project!

Incorporating PNG Assets into Your Asteroids Classic Game
PNG vs Other Image Formats for Game Sprites
Using PNG files for your game’s sprites and assets is both common and advisable. PNG images support lossless compression and transparency, making them ideal for 2D game graphics like ships, asteroids, and UI elements. In fact, game developers typically choose PNG for sprite artwork (especially those with flat colors or pixel-art style) and only use formats like JPEG for large, detailed backgrounds
gamedev.stackexchange.com
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. The original 1979 Asteroids used wireframe vector graphics instead of any bitmapped sprites
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
, but modern recreations almost always use raster images (sprites) on pixel-based displays. In short, your PNG assets are absolutely usable – they’ll provide the visual detail and style you want, while keeping image quality high (no compression artifacts) and allowing transparent backgrounds for irregular shapes. One thing to keep in mind is that once loaded into memory, all image formats occupy roughly the same space (each pixel is typically stored in RGBA format). The difference between PNG, JPEG, etc. mainly affects file size and loading time, not runtime performance
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. So, you don’t need to convert PNGs to another format for performance – just ensure your PNG files are reasonably optimized (you can compress them without quality loss using tools like TinyPNG, for example). Also note that memory usage scales with image resolution, so avoid using an excessively high resolution PNG if you’ll be drawing it scaled down. It’s often best to size your assets to the max resolution they’ll appear on screen to save memory, or have multiple sizes if targeting different screen densities.
Integrating PNG Graphics: Options and Best Practices
With your PNG art ready, the next step is integrating those images into the game. Since you’ve wisely separated the art into its own branch, you can merge them once the game logic is ready without disrupting development – a practice many studios follow to let programming and art progress in parallel
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. Here are some strategies and best practices for using the PNG assets:
Pre-load Your Images: Ensure all your PNG assets are loaded before the game action starts. In an HTML5 canvas context (which your Asteroids Classic likely uses), this means creating Image objects for each asset, setting their .src, and waiting for their onload event before entering the main game loop
rembound.com
rembound.com
. Preloading prevents gameplay from pausing later when an image is first drawn. Many developers implement a simple loading screen or progress counter while assets load
rembound.com
. This way, by the time the player sees the start screen or clicks “Start”, all your sprite images (ship, asteroids, explosions, UI, etc.) are ready in memory.
Drawing and Transforming Images: Once loaded, rendering a PNG on the canvas is straightforward with context.drawImage(). You can draw the full image or specify source rectangles if you’re using spritesheets (more on that shortly)
rembound.com
. If you need to rotate or scale sprites (e.g. rotating the ship or asteroids), you have a couple of options:
Canvas transforms: Save the canvas context, use ctx.translate() and ctx.rotate() to orient, then draw the image, and restore the context. This lets you rotate the PNG sprite around a pivot (usually its center) before drawing. It’s simple but does the math each frame.
Pre-rotated sprites: For something like an asteroid that might rotate continuously, some games generate pre-rotated images (or have multiple frames) so that drawing doesn’t require real-time rotation. However, given modern hardware and the simplicity of Asteroids, using canvas rotation is usually fine unless you have dozens of large sprites rotating simultaneously.
Sprite sheets for animation: If any entity has multiple animation frames (for example, an animated explosion or a flickering thruster), it’s often convenient to pack those frames into a single PNG sheet and draw sub-rectangles. This keeps related frames in one file and can reduce the number of image files your game loads.
Sprite Sheets vs Individual Images: Many developers combine small images into larger sprite sheets (atlases) to optimize performance. Using a few large images instead of many small ones can speed up load times and rendering by reducing file requests and enabling sprite batching
codeandweb.com
. In practice, this means you might take all your asteroid pieces, ship frames, and pickups and pack them into one or two PNG files, along with a JSON specifying the coordinates of each sprite. The benefit is fewer draw calls or context state changes, since the game can draw many sprites from the same atlas in one go
codeandweb.com
. However, for a project of this scope, sprite sheets are an optimization, not a necessity – if you only have a handful of PNG assets, loading a dozen separate files is usually fine. As your game grows (e.g. more UI elements, power-up icons, multiple enemy types), consider using an atlas to keep things efficient.
Asset Organization and Loading Pipeline: Organize your PNG files in a clear structure (it looks like you have an assets/ folder already, which is great). Many games use subfolders (e.g. assets/sprites/, assets/ui/, assets/backgrounds/) to keep things tidy. If you’re using a build tool like Vite (as mentioned in a related Asteroids project) or bundler, take advantage of that by importing images or ensuring the assets folder is served correctly. Also, watch out for caching and path issues – during development, an image might seem to not update if the browser cached it, so a cache-busting trick (renaming or proper HTTP headers) can help when you replace assets.
Transparency and Color Formats: Since PNG supports full alpha transparency, you can have nicely anti-aliased edges on your asteroids and ship that blend with the background. Just make sure when exporting art that the alpha channel is preserved (e.g. no unintended opaque backgrounds). In-game, the canvas will render the transparent parts correctly over space. If you have any semi-transparent effects (like a thrust glow or particle), PNG can handle that too. In contrast, formats like BMP or older GIF either don’t support alpha or are paletted – which is why PNG is the de-facto choice for 2D game art today
gamedev.stackexchange.com
.
How Other Games Handle Art Assets
Your approach of focusing on gameplay first and handling art separately is very much in line with industry best practices. Many developers use placeholder graphics or simple shapes during coding, then swap in final art when it’s ready – this decouples programming and art schedules so neither blocks the other
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. For example, early versions of levels in some games use simple colored blocks or wireframes (like the famous all-orange textures in Half-Life 2’s prototype levels) to test gameplay before artwork is finished
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. In your case, using basic shapes for the ship/asteroids while perfecting movement and collision was wise. Now you can drop in the PNG sprites with minimal code changes, because your game logic (physics, collision, wrapping, etc.) doesn’t depend on how the objects look. When it comes to branching and integration, some teams do exactly what you’re doing: keep art asset changes on a separate Git branch until they’re reviewed or until a milestone, then merge into the main line. This avoids cluttering the main development branch with large binary assets and allows easy reversion if an artist is experimenting. In bigger studios, artists might even commit to a separate branch that auto-merges after passing tests
randompoison.github.io
, but on a small project, a manual merge when ready is fine. The key point is that there’s no issue using PNGs directly in the codebase – just ensure your version control is handling them (Git LFS is sometimes used for very large binary files, but small PNGs can be committed normally). Other games similar to yours (Asteroids clones or retro-style shooters) typically handle assets in a few possible ways:
Vector Graphics: A few clones stick to vector-drawn shapes (programmatically drawing lines/polygons each frame) to mimic the authentic arcade look
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
. This has the advantage of resolution independence and a certain charm, but it limits you to a monochrome line-art style. Since you have full-color PNG artwork, you’re opting for a more modern sprite aesthetic – which is perfectly fine and very common.
Sprite Reuse and Variation: Games often reuse the same sprite for multiple purposes or create variations to add interest. For example, you might have a few different asteroid images so they don’t all look identical. You could achieve this either by having multiple PNG files or by having one spritesheet containing several asteroid variations. Some clones even generate asteroid shapes procedurally (random polygons) for endless variety, but that’s an advanced technique. Using hand-drawn PNGs will give your game a distinct visual style, especially if you have variations (which it sounds like you might, given talk of an “art branch” – maybe different asteroid designs or a more detailed ship).
UI and Backgrounds: Many games use PNGs for UI overlays (lives icons, score panels, buttons) and sometimes for background images. If your game has a starfield background or static backdrop, a JPEG could be used there if it’s a complex photo-like image; but often a tiled PNG or even procedurally drawn starfield is used. The commits you have (mentioning start_screen.png and gameEnd.png) show you’re using PNGs for full-screen graphics as well, which is fine. Just ensure they are sized appropriately for your canvas resolution to avoid scaling blurriness or slow load times. You can always downscale large images if needed.
Audio/Other Assets: (Though your question is about PNGs, a quick note: similarly, games handle audio and other assets by preloading and using appropriate formats. Since art is your focus now, make sure to also have a plan for preloading sounds when you add them, so the first gunshot or explosion doesn’t stutter due to lazy loading.)
Ensuring a Solid Base for Expansion
It’s great that you’re evaluating the codebase now that core gameplay is in place. A solid foundation will make it much easier to build on new features (and integrate art smoothly). From a high-level perspective, here are some recommendations to check against your Asteroids Classic codebase:
Separation of Concerns (Logic vs Rendering): Ideally, your game objects (ship, asteroids, bullets, etc.) should have their game logic (position, velocity, collision detection) separated from the rendering code. If, for example, you currently have a method like Asteroid.draw(ctx) that draws a polygon, you can modify it to draw an image instead – as long as the rest of the game doesn’t care how the asteroid is drawn. It sounds like you are indeed separating them (art branch vs game branch implies rendering can be swapped out without rewriting game mechanics). Continue to keep rendering code modular. For instance, you could give each object a property for its sprite image, or an enum for its appearance type (so a game object might choose between “draw polygon” or “draw image” based on what’s set). This way, toggling between placeholder art and final art is easy.
Game Loop and Timing: Make sure your base handles the game loop consistently (using requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps rendering, and maybe a fixed-step or delta timing for physics). A solid game loop will ensure that adding more assets or even more entities won’t break the feel of the game. If your game logic is frame-rate dependent, consider refactoring to use time deltas so it runs the same on slower or faster machines. This isn’t directly related to PNG assets, but it’s a “solid base” concern that pays off as the project grows.
Scalability of Asset Management: Right now, you might load images by hardcoding file paths in an array or in code. As the project grows, consider maintaining an asset manifest or loader utility. For example, an object or JSON that lists all assets with keys, so you can load them in one place and easily reference them by name throughout your code. This avoids sprinkling image paths or loading logic all over. It’s not required for a small game, but it’s a good practice if you plan to expand features (you mentioned things like currency pickups, hangar shop, etc., which means more graphics and possibly an inventory of assets).
Memory and Performance Checks: After integrating the PNG art, test how the game runs on target platforms (in a browser, maybe on both desktop and mobile if applicable). Ensure that adding graphics hasn’t introduced any lag. With canvas games, a common performance killer is accidentally redrawing too large an area or too many objects per frame. If you see slowdowns, tools like the browser dev timeline can show if rendering is the bottleneck. Often, using images doesn’t slow things down significantly for a game of this size, but if, say, you fill the screen with dozens of large PNGs with alpha effects, you might need to tune it (e.g., limiting the size of particles or turning off alpha on expensive operations). The good news is that drawing a small image is often faster than drawing an equivalent complex vector shape via code, because the image blitting is usually GPU-accelerated. So moving from vector-drawn asteroids to PNG sprites should not harm performance and might even improve it, as long as you’re not drastically increasing the number of objects.
Future-Proofing and Refactoring: Since you also have an AsteroidV2 refactoring in progress (with a React/TypeScript angle, as I gleaned), you’re already taking steps to improve the architecture. TypeScript can catch a lot of bugs early and help structure your entities with clear types/interfaces – a plus for maintainability. If your base “classic” code was getting messy, the refactor is likely making it cleaner (e.g. splitting code into modules, maybe separating game state management from rendering, etc.). It’s worth verifying that in the new structure, things like game state (score, lives, current level) and game entities are managed in a way that isn’t tightly coupled to the DOM or canvas. For example, in a React shell you might handle UI in React but game in a canvas element; make sure to keep those concerns isolated.
Testing and Debugging Tools: A solid base is one you can easily test and debug. Consider building little debug aids: for instance, a toggle to switch between placeholder shapes and the new PNG sprites for comparison, or a bounding-box overlay to ensure collisions still align with the new graphics. If your asteroid PNGs are larger or differently shaped than the old placeholders, you may need to adjust collision radii. A quick debug draw of collision circles can help fine-tune that. These kinds of tools make it easier to expand and ensure everything remains balanced.
Finally, assess if the current feature set meets your goals or if introducing a game framework would help going forward. Since you have a working base, it’s usually best to continue building on it rather than rewriting everything in a new engine, unless you have specific needs (e.g., physics engine, advanced audio, or cross-platform publishing) that the current vanilla approach can’t handle. Many classic arcade clones are successfully built with plain JavaScript/TypeScript and canvas, so you’re on the right track. The base you have is worth building on as long as it’s organized. If you find any part of the code becoming a bottleneck (for example, difficulty managing game states or adding new object types), that might be a cue to refactor that portion (or see how other open-source Asteroids clones structured it). But given what you’ve done so far, you should be in a good position to proceed. In summary, PNG assets are a great choice for your game and widely used by other developers for similar purposes. Integrate them by preloading and drawing with proper techniques, and consider sprite sheets if you have many assets. Other games handle art by separating it from core logic (often using placeholders first, just like you did) and by using atlases or optimized formats when needed. Continue to keep your code modular and your game loop tight, and your Asteroids Classic codebase will be a solid foundation to build upon for new features and polish. With a strong base, you can confidently add all the cool stuff (enhanced graphics, effects, UI, and beyond) knowing the underlying game will support it. Good luck, and happy coding! Sources:

To move forward with your request, I need to clarify a few things:

You mentioned having a PNG for the ship—do you want help with integrating that now, or should that be staged for a later pass?

For improving the asteroids, should I prioritize shader-based solutions (WebGL/Canvas), image-based textures, or a mix?

Should I research upgrade paths and roguelite mechanics specific to space shooters, or general roguelites?

For UI/UX, do you want reference games, visual style direction, or both?

For the QA/hygiene pass, should I focus only on the existing GitHub repo (Snootypants/asteroidsClassic), or are there other sources/codebases I should include?

Let me know so I can proceed precisely.

Understood. I’ll start by:

Evaluating how best to integrate PNG assets like your ship into the game loop and rendering pipeline.

Exploring how other developers enhance asteroid visuals, including shader tricks, animated textures, and 3D-illusion techniques.

Researching roguelite upgrade and progression systems—focusing on both permanent hangar-style upgrades and in-run random upgrades.

Game Design and QA Audit for AsteroidsClassic

Incorporating PNG Assets into Your Asteroids Classic Game
PNG vs Other Image Formats for Game Sprites
Using PNG files for your game’s sprites and assets is both common and advisable. PNG images support lossless compression and transparency, making them ideal for 2D game graphics like ships, asteroids, and UI elements. In fact, game developers typically choose PNG for sprite artwork (especially those with flat colors or pixel-art style) and only use formats like JPEG for large, detailed backgrounds
gamedev.stackexchange.com
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. The original 1979 Asteroids used wireframe vector graphics instead of any bitmapped sprites
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
, but modern recreations almost always use raster images (sprites) on pixel-based displays. In short, your PNG assets are absolutely usable – they’ll provide the visual detail and style you want, while keeping image quality high (no compression artifacts) and allowing transparent backgrounds for irregular shapes. One thing to keep in mind is that once loaded into memory, all image formats occupy roughly the same space (each pixel is typically stored in RGBA format). The difference between PNG, JPEG, etc. mainly affects file size and loading time, not runtime performance
gamedev.stackexchange.com
. So, you don’t need to convert PNGs to another format for performance – just ensure your PNG files are reasonably optimized (you can compress them without quality loss using tools like TinyPNG, for example). Also note that memory usage scales with image resolution, so avoid using an excessively high resolution PNG if you’ll be drawing it scaled down. It’s often best to size your assets to the max resolution they’ll appear on screen to save memory, or have multiple sizes if targeting different screen densities.
Integrating PNG Graphics: Options and Best Practices
With your PNG art ready, the next step is integrating those images into the game. Since you’ve wisely separated the art into its own branch, you can merge them once the game logic is ready without disrupting development – a practice many studios follow to let programming and art progress in parallel
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. Here are some strategies and best practices for using the PNG assets:
Pre-load Your Images: Ensure all your PNG assets are loaded before the game action starts. In an HTML5 canvas context (which your Asteroids Classic likely uses), this means creating Image objects for each asset, setting their .src, and waiting for their onload event before entering the main game loop
rembound.com
rembound.com
. Preloading prevents gameplay from pausing later when an image is first drawn. Many developers implement a simple loading screen or progress counter while assets load
rembound.com
. This way, by the time the player sees the start screen or clicks “Start”, all your sprite images (ship, asteroids, explosions, UI, etc.) are ready in memory.
Drawing and Transforming Images: Once loaded, rendering a PNG on the canvas is straightforward with context.drawImage(). You can draw the full image or specify source rectangles if you’re using spritesheets (more on that shortly)
rembound.com
. If you need to rotate or scale sprites (e.g. rotating the ship or asteroids), you have a couple of options:
Canvas transforms: Save the canvas context, use ctx.translate() and ctx.rotate() to orient, then draw the image, and restore the context. This lets you rotate the PNG sprite around a pivot (usually its center) before drawing. It’s simple but does the math each frame.
Pre-rotated sprites: For something like an asteroid that might rotate continuously, some games generate pre-rotated images (or have multiple frames) so that drawing doesn’t require real-time rotation. However, given modern hardware and the simplicity of Asteroids, using canvas rotation is usually fine unless you have dozens of large sprites rotating simultaneously.
Sprite sheets for animation: If any entity has multiple animation frames (for example, an animated explosion or a flickering thruster), it’s often convenient to pack those frames into a single PNG sheet and draw sub-rectangles. This keeps related frames in one file and can reduce the number of image files your game loads.
Sprite Sheets vs Individual Images: Many developers combine small images into larger sprite sheets (atlases) to optimize performance. Using a few large images instead of many small ones can speed up load times and rendering by reducing file requests and enabling sprite batching
codeandweb.com
. In practice, this means you might take all your asteroid pieces, ship frames, and pickups and pack them into one or two PNG files, along with a JSON specifying the coordinates of each sprite. The benefit is fewer draw calls or context state changes, since the game can draw many sprites from the same atlas in one go
codeandweb.com
. However, for a project of this scope, sprite sheets are an optimization, not a necessity – if you only have a handful of PNG assets, loading a dozen separate files is usually fine. As your game grows (e.g. more UI elements, power-up icons, multiple enemy types), consider using an atlas to keep things efficient.
Asset Organization and Loading Pipeline: Organize your PNG files in a clear structure (it looks like you have an assets/ folder already, which is great). Many games use subfolders (e.g. assets/sprites/, assets/ui/, assets/backgrounds/) to keep things tidy. If you’re using a build tool like Vite (as mentioned in a related Asteroids project) or bundler, take advantage of that by importing images or ensuring the assets folder is served correctly. Also, watch out for caching and path issues – during development, an image might seem to not update if the browser cached it, so a cache-busting trick (renaming or proper HTTP headers) can help when you replace assets.
Transparency and Color Formats: Since PNG supports full alpha transparency, you can have nicely anti-aliased edges on your asteroids and ship that blend with the background. Just make sure when exporting art that the alpha channel is preserved (e.g. no unintended opaque backgrounds). In-game, the canvas will render the transparent parts correctly over space. If you have any semi-transparent effects (like a thrust glow or particle), PNG can handle that too. In contrast, formats like BMP or older GIF either don’t support alpha or are paletted – which is why PNG is the de-facto choice for 2D game art today

How Other Games Handle Art Assets
Your approach of focusing on gameplay first and handling art separately is very much in line with industry best practices. Many developers use placeholder graphics or simple shapes during coding, then swap in final art when it’s ready – this decouples programming and art schedules so neither blocks the other
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. For example, early versions of levels in some games use simple colored blocks or wireframes (like the famous all-orange textures in Half-Life 2’s prototype levels) to test gameplay before artwork is finished
xnameetingpoint.weebly.com
. In your case, using basic shapes for the ship/asteroids while perfecting movement and collision was wise. Now you can drop in the PNG sprites with minimal code changes, because your game logic (physics, collision, wrapping, etc.) doesn’t depend on how the objects look. When it comes to branching and integration, some teams do exactly what you’re doing: keep art asset changes on a separate Git branch until they’re reviewed or until a milestone, then merge into the main line. This avoids cluttering the main development branch with large binary assets and allows easy reversion if an artist is experimenting. In bigger studios, artists might even commit to a separate branch that auto-merges after passing tests
randompoison.github.io
, but on a small project, a manual merge when ready is fine. The key point is that there’s no issue using PNGs directly in the codebase – just ensure your version control is handling them (Git LFS is sometimes used for very large binary files, but small PNGs can be committed normally). Other games similar to yours (Asteroids clones or retro-style shooters) typically handle assets in a few possible ways:
Vector Graphics: A few clones stick to vector-drawn shapes (programmatically drawing lines/polygons each frame) to mimic the authentic arcade look
20_games_challenge.gitlab.io
. This has the advantage of resolution independence and a certain charm, but it limits you to a monochrome line-art style. Since you have full-color PNG artwork, you’re opting for a more modern sprite aesthetic – which is perfectly fine and very common.
Sprite Reuse and Variation: Games often reuse the same sprite for multiple purposes or create variations to add interest. For example, you might have a few different asteroid images so they don’t all look identical. You could achieve this either by having multiple PNG files or by having one spritesheet containing several asteroid variations. Some clones even generate asteroid shapes procedurally (random polygons) for endless variety, but that’s an advanced technique. Using hand-drawn PNGs will give your game a distinct visual style, especially if you have variations (which it sounds like you might, given talk of an “art branch” – maybe different asteroid designs or a more detailed ship).
UI and Backgrounds: Many games use PNGs for UI overlays (lives icons, score panels, buttons) and sometimes for background images. If your game has a starfield background or static backdrop, a JPEG could be used there if it’s a complex photo-like image; but often a tiled PNG or even procedurally drawn starfield is used. The commits you have (mentioning start_screen.png and gameEnd.png) show you’re using PNGs for full-screen graphics as well, which is fine. Just ensure they are sized appropriately for your canvas resolution to avoid scaling blurriness or slow load times. You can always downscale large images if needed.
Audio/Other Assets: (Though your question is about PNGs, a quick note: similarly, games handle audio and other assets by preloading and using appropriate formats. Since art is your focus now, make sure to also have a plan for preloading sounds when you add them, so the first gunshot or explosion doesn’t stutter due to lazy loading.)
Ensuring a Solid Base for Expansion
It’s great that you’re evaluating the codebase now that core gameplay is in place. A solid foundation will make it much easier to build on new features (and integrate art smoothly). From a high-level perspective, here are some recommendations to check against your Asteroids Classic codebase:
Separation of Concerns (Logic vs Rendering): Ideally, your game objects (ship, asteroids, bullets, etc.) should have their game logic (position, velocity, collision detection) separated from the rendering code. If, for example, you currently have a method like Asteroid.draw(ctx) that draws a polygon, you can modify it to draw an image instead – as long as the rest of the game doesn’t care how the asteroid is drawn. It sounds like you are indeed separating them (art branch vs game branch implies rendering can be swapped out without rewriting game mechanics). Continue to keep rendering code modular. For instance, you could give each object a property for its sprite image, or an enum for its appearance type (so a game object might choose between “draw polygon” or “draw image” based on what’s set). This way, toggling between placeholder art and final art is easy.
Game Loop and Timing: Make sure your base handles the game loop consistently (using requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps rendering, and maybe a fixed-step or delta timing for physics). A solid game loop will ensure that adding more assets or even more entities won’t break the feel of the game. If your game logic is frame-rate dependent, consider refactoring to use time deltas so it runs the same on slower or faster machines. This isn’t directly related to PNG assets, but it’s a “solid base” concern that pays off as the project grows.
Scalability of Asset Management: Right now, you might load images by hardcoding file paths in an array or in code. As the project grows, consider maintaining an asset manifest or loader utility. For example, an object or JSON that lists all assets with keys, so you can load them in one place and easily reference them by name throughout your code. This avoids sprinkling image paths or loading logic all over. It’s not required for a small game, but it’s a good practice if you plan to expand features (you mentioned things like currency pickups, hangar shop, etc., which means more graphics and possibly an inventory of assets).
Memory and Performance Checks: After integrating the PNG art, test how the game runs on target platforms (in a browser, maybe on both desktop and mobile if applicable). Ensure that adding graphics hasn’t introduced any lag. With canvas games, a common performance killer is accidentally redrawing too large an area or too many objects per frame. If you see slowdowns, tools like the browser dev timeline can show if rendering is the bottleneck. Often, using images doesn’t slow things down significantly for a game of this size, but if, say, you fill the screen with dozens of large PNGs with alpha effects, you might need to tune it (e.g., limiting the size of particles or turning off alpha on expensive operations). The good news is that drawing a small image is often faster than drawing an equivalent complex vector shape via code, because the image blitting is usually GPU-accelerated. So moving from vector-drawn asteroids to PNG sprites should not harm performance and might even improve it, as long as you’re not drastically increasing the number of objects.
Future-Proofing and Refactoring: Since you also have an AsteroidV2 refactoring in progress (with a React/TypeScript angle, as I gleaned), you’re already taking steps to improve the architecture. TypeScript can catch a lot of bugs early and help structure your entities with clear types/interfaces – a plus for maintainability. If your base “classic” code was getting messy, the refactor is likely making it cleaner (e.g. splitting code into modules, maybe separating game state management from rendering, etc.). It’s worth verifying that in the new structure, things like game state (score, lives, current level) and game entities are managed in a way that isn’t tightly coupled to the DOM or canvas. For example, in a React shell you might handle UI in React but game in a canvas element; make sure to keep those concerns isolated.
Testing and Debugging Tools: A solid base is one you can easily test and debug. Consider building little debug aids: for instance, a toggle to switch between placeholder shapes and the new PNG sprites for comparison, or a bounding-box overlay to ensure collisions still align with the new graphics. If your asteroid PNGs are larger or differently shaped than the old placeholders, you may need to adjust collision radii. A quick debug draw of collision circles can help fine-tune that. These kinds of tools make it easier to expand and ensure everything remains balanced.
Finally, assess if the current feature set meets your goals or if introducing a game framework would help going forward. Since you have a working base, it’s usually best to continue building on it rather than rewriting everything in a new engine, unless you have specific needs (e.g., physics engine, advanced audio, or cross-platform publishing) that the current vanilla approach can’t handle. Many classic arcade clones are successfully built with plain JavaScript/TypeScript and canvas, so you’re on the right track. The base you have is worth building on as long as it’s organized. If you find any part of the code becoming a bottleneck (for example, difficulty managing game states or adding new object types), that might be a cue to refactor that portion (or see how other open-source Asteroids clones structured it). But given what you’ve done so far, you should be in a good position to proceed. In summary, PNG assets are a great choice for your game and widely used by other developers for similar purposes. Integrate them by preloading and drawing with proper techniques, and consider sprite sheets if you have many assets. Other games handle art by separating it from core logic (often using placeholders first, just like you did) and by using atlases or optimized formats when needed. Continue to keep your code modular and your game loop tight, and your Asteroids Classic codebase will be a solid foundation to build upon for new features and polish. With a strong base, you can confidently add all the cool stuff (enhanced graphics, effects, UI, and beyond) knowing the underlying game will support it. Good luck, and happy coding! Sources:

AsteroidsClassic Visual Upgrade, Game Design, and QA Pass

Graphics and Visual Enhancements
Ship Sprite Integration: Replacing the player’s ship with a PNG sprite is straightforward now that an asset pipeline is set up. The public/assets/ directory can hold the ship image (e.g. assets/ship/ship1.png), and the game can load it via an <img> tag or by drawing it to the canvas
GitHub
. Ensure the sprite’s dimensions and orientation match the game’s expectations (e.g. ship pointing up if the game assumes that). Once integrated, remove any old vector-drawing code for the ship and adjust collision bounds to the sprite’s size. This provides an immediate visual upgrade without altering gameplay. Textured & Detailed Asteroids: Currently asteroids are drawn as white-outlined polygons
GitHub
GitHub
. To make them more detailed and 3D-looking, consider filling those polygon shapes with a stone texture. In HTML5 Canvas, you can create an Image object (e.g. a rocky pattern) and use ctx.createPattern(image, "repeat") to make a fill style
stackoverflow.com
. Then draw the asteroid polygon and call ctx.fill() instead of (or in addition to) ctx.stroke. The texture will fill the shape, and because the canvas context is rotated each frame by the asteroid’s angle
GitHub
GitHub
, the texture will rotate with it, simulating a spinning surface. This approach keeps asteroids procedurally generated (for irregular outlines) but with a consistent rocky appearance. You might still draw a subtle outline or drop the outline for a fully filled look. Adjust the texture’s brightness or color to match the game’s style (e.g. gray rock with slight shading). The result should be asteroids that look less like wireframes and more like solid rocks. Technical tip: ensure the texture image is loaded and ready before drawing; you can initialize the pattern once and reuse it for all asteroids for efficiency. Enhanced Starfield Background: The current starfield is already dense (~2000 stars) with parallax layers and varied brightness
GitHub
. To push it further, you could add twinkling stars or subtle color variation. A simple method is to randomly vary each star’s brightness slightly during each draw cycle
excessivelyadequate.com
, giving a twinkle effect. You can implement this by drawing stars with an alpha that oscillates or with occasional flicker on a random subset of stars. Another enhancement is to include color variety based on star distance – for example, distant stars tinted blue and nearer stars warm white
godotshaders.com
. This mimics how stars can appear different (blue giants vs red dwarfs) and adds depth. Since you already use parallax for depth, you can assign a color or size to each star layer (e.g. far layer stars are smaller and bluish, close layer stars larger and white). The parallax layering can also be increased to 3+ layers, perhaps with an extra layer of a few large, very distant stars that move very slowly
godotshaders.com
. Finally, consider occasional special effects: for instance, a rare “shooting star” streak or a faint nebula cloud in the background. These should be used sparingly to avoid distraction, but can add that “wow” factor. Overall, the goal is to keep the background lively yet not overpowering – small twinkles and color shifts can make the starfield feel more dynamic without drawing attention away from the gameplay.
Upgrade Systems and Game Balance
Upgrade Paths for Wave vs Survival Modes: Designing upgrade systems for the two modes might require different approaches. In Wave Mode (discrete levels of enemies), you can implement a between-wave upgrade or shop. For example, after clearing a wave, present the player with a choice of upgrades or a store where they spend points/currency for enhancements before the next wave begins. This segmented approach lets players recover or retool between waves. In Survival Mode (endless play until death), the upgrades should occur during the run – often via a level-up system. As the player destroys enemies/asteroids, they accumulate XP and periodically “level up,” triggering an upgrade selection. A popular design (seen in Nova Drift and many roguelites) is to offer a choice of 3 random upgrades at each level-up, from which the player picks one. This was described in Nova Drift, an Asteroids-inspired roguelite where “you finish waves of enemies and level up and pick upgrades… then you do it again”
forum.quartertothree.com
. The random choice adds variety and replay value, ensuring each run yields different builds. Implementing this might involve pausing the action momentarily and showing an upgrade menu with 3 cards or icons for the player to choose from. Types of Upgrades & Balance: Start by brainstorming categories of upgrades. Common ones in space shooters include: weapon upgrades (spread shot, faster fire rate, missiles, lasers, etc.), defensive upgrades (shields, more lives or hull integrity, smaller hitbox), mobility upgrades (faster thrust, better handling), and miscellaneous abilities (e.g. periodic shockwaves, drones that assist in combat, etc.). You might also include upgrades that modify existing stats (fire rate, bullet speed, ship speed, damage, etc.). It’s wise to tier them: basic upgrades first, with more powerful or specialized ones appearing later or after certain prerequisites. For example, Nova Drift separates “Gear” (weapon/shield/body choices) from “Mods” (stackable enhancements) and unlocks the latter after a few levels
lordsofgaming.net
lordsofgaming.net
. You don’t need that same complexity initially, but it illustrates how players can first pick a major path (say, weapon type) and then later refine with smaller upgrades. Balancing Upgrade Progression: Balance is crucial so that the game remains challenging but fair. One strategy is to use an XP curve that increases per level – i.e., each new level requires more XP than the last. This prevents the player from leveling up too fast and stacking all upgrades early. As one player noted about a similar asteroids roguelite, if XP requirements don’t scale, “I was leveling up every few seconds once I had a few levels in”
reddit.com
, which made the game too easy. To avoid this, decide how many upgrades you expect a player to get in an average run and tune the XP curve to deliver that. Also scale enemy difficulty in parallel – e.g., each wave or each few levels, introduce tougher enemies or higher asteroid speeds so that upgrades are needed to survive. If Wave mode is meant to have a finite end (say 10 waves and a boss), ensure a player who reaches the end has roughly a full kit of upgrades but not an invincible juggernaut before the finale. In Survival (endless) mode, since the game will eventually overwhelm the player, you can be more generous with upgrades and see how long they last. Playtesting is key – simulate or log how quickly players gain XP and how effective each upgrade is. If one upgrade combo always trivializes the game, you may need to tone it down or increase difficulty accordingly. Roguelite Elements & Permanent Progression: To increase long-term engagement, you can add permanent upgrades or unlocks outside of a single run – e.g. a hangar or tech tree in the main menu. In this system, players earn some currency or points each run (tied to score, distance, or achievements) that persist after death. They can spend these to unlock new ship abilities, weapons, or slight stat boosts that apply to the start of future runs. This is a hallmark of roguelites: “Play, die, upgrade, and repeat” in a cycle
forum.quartertothree.com
. For example, you might let the player permanently increase their starting lives, or unlock entirely new ship types or starting weapons. Nova Drift does this by unlocking new upgrade options over time
forum.quartertothree.com
 – players noticed “upgrades available that weren’t available before” after successive runs, which keeps the game fresh. Another example is Rogue Legacy (a platformer), where gold from runs upgrades your character’s base stats for the next run; in a space shooter, this could be framed as ship improvements or new tech blueprints that persist. When implementing permanent upgrades, balance is again key: they should make the player stronger, but not so overpowered that eventually the game becomes trivial. One approach is diminishing returns (each upgrade costs more, or has smaller effect as it stacks) or introducing higher difficulty levels to tackle once players have many upgrades. In-Run Drops vs Post-Run Upgrades: You mentioned “nanobots that upgrade the ship given whatever options open up when leveling” – this is a flavorful way to explain the in-run upgrade mechanism (e.g. collect a power-up item that triggers the level-up choice). You can have asteroids sometimes drop these “nanobot” upgrade tokens or just have XP be an automatic accumulation. In addition, classic arcade design allows power-up drops: maybe certain destroyed asteroids or enemy UFOs drop temporary power-ups (like a damage boost, a shield recharge, or one-time items). These add moment-to-moment excitement and decision-making (do you risk going for the power-up?). Just be careful not to overwhelm the player with too many different systems; ensure the player can clearly understand when they leveled up and how to choose an upgrade, versus when a temporary pickup appears. Currency Implementation & Use: If you introduce a new currency (for permanent upgrades or for an in-game shop), decide what form it takes and how it’s earned. A common theme is to have ores or minerals drop from asteroids – for example, Space Miner (another Asteroids-like game) uses the concept of mining asteroid ore which converts to money: “Destroy asteroids, collect different minerals to improve your ship”
store.steampowered.com
. You could likewise assign a point value or currency value to each asteroid (perhaps based on size – larger asteroids drop more) and have the player collect it as floating resources. This currency can then be spent either between waves (at a shop or upgrade screen) or between runs (for permanent boosts, as discussed). To implement it, you’d add a currency counter to the HUD and increment it whenever the player collects a resource. Physically, you could spawn a pickup item that the ship must touch, or simply auto-collect to avoid extra hassle in a fast shooter. Balancing currency involves setting prices for upgrades appropriately. Start by determining how many runs or waves you expect a player to play to afford a meaningful upgrade. You want upgrades to feel rewarding and attainable, but not so cheap that the player unlocks everything in one hour. A typical model: early upgrades are cheap so the player gets a taste of progress, then costs ramp up exponentially for the strongest upgrades. Also consider multiple currencies: maybe one currency for the shop during runs (temporary money) and a separate one for permanent upgrades (e.g. “Upgrade Points” earned only on game over, proportional to score or furthest wave). This prevents the player from having to choose between short-term power (using currency now) and long-term progress – they can engage with both systems separately.
UI/UX and Art Direction
HUD and Interface Design: For a fast-paced space shooter, the HUD should be clear, minimal, and out of the action area. Key elements to display are the player’s lives, score, current level/wave, and perhaps shield/health status. Your current layout places score and lives to the side of the play area and a minimap to the right
GitHub
GitHub
 – that’s a good start, as it keeps central vision focused on gameplay. Moving forward, consider adding an XP bar and level indicator (since you’re adding leveling). In the recent update, a top-centered XP bar was added with a numeric readout
GitHub
GitHub
 – this is a good approach, as players can glance at progress towards the next upgrade. Visual hierarchy is important: the most critical info (maybe lives and health) should be the most prominent, whereas stats like score or wave number can be smaller or tucked in a corner. A UI/UX art director’s advice is to list everything you want on the HUD, rank it by importance, and design around those priorities
reddit.com
. In practice, that means maybe your Lives and Shield are larger icons or distinct colors, while the score is smaller text. Also avoid information overload – show only what the player needs at the moment
reddit.com
. For example, if you implement a temporary power-up, you might show an icon and duration only when active, then hide it when not. Keep the HUD lean so that it doesn’t clutter the screen or distract. Upgrade Selection UI: When the player levels up (in survival mode) or between waves, you’ll need a UI for choosing upgrades. Generally, it’s best to pause or slow the game during this to give players time to read choices. You can overlay a semi-transparent panel with 3 upgrade cards/buttons. Each should have a concise title, an icon if possible, and a short description. Maintain a consistent style for these panels – for instance, a futuristic tech border or a simple translucent black box – and use a readable font (sans-serif fonts are usually preferred for legibility in games
reddit.com
). Test the text size by actually viewing it in-game; players shouldn’t have to squint or read paragraphs mid-action. Tooltips or extended info can be available on hover or a “More info” key, but the basic effect should be clear (“+20% fire rate” or “Gain homing missiles”). Visual Style and Cohesion: It’s important that the ship, asteroids, background, and UI all feel like they belong to the same game. Right now you’re transitioning from pure vectors to raster images. Decide on an art direction: will it be retro neon (glowing outlines and particles), pixel art (chunky pixelated ship and asteroids for a classic feel), or a more modern painted look (textured asteroids, high-res ship sprite, etc.)? Each approach can work, but you should unify around one. For example, if the ship PNG is a sleek colored graphic, having asteroids textured similarly (instead of pure white lines) will match it better. Likewise, the starfield colors should complement the overall color scheme (e.g. if the game objects are mostly grayscale with bright highlights, the stars could remain white/blue; if you go neon, the stars might have neon purple/blue glows, etc.). The UI can either be diegetic (styled like in-world holograms) or simply functional. A clean, contrasty UI often works best: e.g. light text on a dark translucent background, or vice versa, so it’s readable at a glance. Use color coding in the UI sparingly but smartly – for instance, you might display lives or health in green (turning red when low), and use a consistent color for XP or currency. One player feedback point for a similar game was to use color to distinguish elements: “bad stuff in the red/orange range, good stuff in blue/green”

That’s a good rule of thumb: enemy bullets/explosions could have a warm hue, whereas player projectiles or power-ups have cooler hues, so the player can instantly tell if an object is a threat or a reward. Approach to Developing Art Assets: If you’re not an artist, don’t worry – there are resources to help. You can find free or inexpensive asset packs for space games (for example, on sites like itch.io or OpenGameArt, there are asteroid and spaceship sprite packs
itch.io
opengameart.org
). Using consistent asset packs ensures everything has a unified style (same artist or method). Alternatively, you can generate or draw them yourself: asteroids can be made by sketching irregular shapes and applying a rock texture in an image editor, or even using procedural generation (there are tutorials for generating 2D asteroid sprites via code or noise). The ship sprite you have is a start; if you need more (like different ship models or enemy UFOs), try to use the same rendering style. Art direction also extends to effects – consider adding particle effects for explosions, thrust, etc., which add juice to the visuals. These particles (sparks, debris) should also match the style (for example, pixel-art particles if you go pixel art, or glow particles if you go neon). When in doubt, consistency and simplicity win – a cohesive simple style looks better than a mix of realistic and cartoon elements. As you design the UI, maintain consistency there too: use at most two fonts (one for headers and one for body text) and keep font styles uniform (e.g. don’t mix a fantasy font with a sci-fi font). The HUD panels and menus should use the same color palette and widget styles (same button shapes, corners, etc.), so it all feels like one interface.
Code Quality and Optimization
Eliminating Hard-Coded Values: In the earlier code audit, many “magic numbers” were refactored into constants (e.g. ship physics constants, world size, star counts)
GitHub
. Continue this practice for any new features. For instance, if you add an XP system, define constants for the XP needed at base level, or a growth rate, instead of embedding numbers in logic. This makes tweaking the balance much easier. Similarly, upgrade effects (like “+20% fire rate”) might be best stored in a configuration object or at least clearly commented, rather than just applied ad hoc in code. The improvements already made (e.g. using INITIAL_LIVES instead of a literal 3 in state) should be maintained
GitHub
GitHub
. Take a pass through the code to see if any numbers slipped through – for example, any UI layout dimensions or timeouts that are still literals. Turning those into named constants (perhaps in constants.js or a new constants-ui.js for interface-related numbers) will keep the project easy to adjust. Performance Considerations: The game is using React for UI and Canvas for rendering the game world. One notable improvement was throttling React state updates to only update when necessary
GitHub
. Right now, the game loop calls setUiState every frame with the latest score, lives, etc., but always spreading prev state
GitHub
. To truly minimize re-renders, you could check if the values actually changed before setting state. For instance, keep track of the last drawn score, and only call setUiState when scoreRef.current differs from the last value. Otherwise, React may still reconcile the virtual DOM every frame (even if the values are the same) because a new object is being produced. That said, since you’ve already reduced expensive computations, this is a micro-optimization; focus first on higher-level performance: ensure the canvas drawing code is efficient (use requestAnimationFrame as you do, avoid unnecessary canvas state changes like too many saves/restores, etc.). Also consider capping certain effects for performance – e.g. the starfield has 2000 stars; if you ever find it slows older devices, you could scale that down or canvas-draw the starfield once as a static background and only move a smaller set of nearby stars. Memory and Cleanup: Make sure that event listeners (keyboard, mouse) are properly removed when the component unmounts or when they’re no longer needed. For example, if you added a window resize listener for responsive layout, use useEffect cleanup to remove it. The pointer lock or mouse movement events should also be cleaned up on unmount. The game loop already cancels the animation frame on unmount
GitHub
, which is good. Watch out for any timers or intervals (perhaps in the new upgrade or spawn systems) – clear them on game over or unmount to prevent leaks or unwanted calls after the game ends. Robustness and Edge Cases: Do a fresh QA pass focusing on potential edge cases. For example, what happens when the player dies in Survival mode – does the game properly reset all necessary state (score, level, etc.) when starting a new run? The new code sets stats back to initial values on start
GitHub
, which is good. Verify that in both modes. Also, test the transition from menu -> game -> game over -> menu repeatedly to ensure there’s no accumulated state (e.g. lingering asteroids from a previous run). Another edge case: if the player reaches max level or if XP goes beyond xpMax, make sure it rolls over properly (e.g. subtract xpMax, increment level, and increase the next xpMax perhaps). If not yet implemented, add logic for leveling up: when xp >= xpMax, do xp -= xpMax; level += 1; xpMax *= growthFactor; (or whatever formula) and then trigger the upgrade selection UI. Planned Features Integration: As you add upgrades and currency, keep code quality in mind. It might be wise to refactor some logic out of App.jsx into dedicated modules. For example, you could have an UpgradeManager that handles the list of possible upgrades, applying an upgrade to the player ship, etc. This keeps the main game loop cleaner. Similarly, a Shop or Hangar module could manage permanent upgrades and store data (maybe in localStorage or a backend, if persistence is needed). Encapsulating these systems will prevent App.jsx from becoming too monolithic. Be Brutal – Any Remaining Issues: Finally, here are a few nitpicks to aim for perfection:
Restart Mode Consistency: Noticed in the UI patch that when the Game Over screen offers “Play Again”, it always starts wave mode
GitHub
. If the player was in Survival, you might want “Play Again” to respect that mode. It’s a small detail, but maintaining the chosen mode improves user experience.
Input Handling Efficiency: If you haven’t already, ensure that input checks (keys pressed, mouse movement) are done efficiently each frame or via events. Avoid heavy computations in those checks. Given the simple control scheme, this is likely fine.
Comments and Documentation: Continue to document any non-obvious code. For example, if using a formula for XP growth or a particular balancing decision, leave a comment (and perhaps a reference to where the idea came from, if applicable). This will help future you or collaborators understand the rationale.
Testing New Features: You have a nice test setup (Vitest) with some coverage on collision and limits
GitHub
. Consider writing a few tests for the upgrade logic (e.g. a test that simulates gaining XP and leveling up, ensuring the values reset correctly, and that choosing an upgrade applies the correct effect). Testing the game’s random aspects can be tricky, but you can structure the upgrade selection in a testable way (e.g. a function that given a list of upgrades and a random seed, returns 3 choices – then test that no matter what, it never picks an unavailable upgrade, etc.). This level of thoroughness catches bugs early.
Overall, the codebase has improved significantly in cleanliness and performance (as noted in the improvements doc: 20+ magic numbers removed, DRYed up duplicate code, and cut React re-renders dramatically
GitHub
GitHub
). By extending the same rigor to new features, you’ll keep the project maintainable. In summary, focus on clear separation of concerns (game logic vs UI vs data), use constants/config for tunable values, and test for edge cases. With these practices, the game will not only play great with the new upgrades, but the code underneath will be robust and easy to refine further – which is exactly what we want for a long-term project!

Graphics and Visual Enhancements
Ship Sprite Integration: Replacing the player’s ship with a PNG sprite is straightforward now that an asset pipeline is set up. The public/assets/ directory can hold the ship image (e.g. assets/ship/ship1.png), and the game can load it via an <img> tag or by drawing it to the canvas
GitHub
. Ensure the sprite’s dimensions and orientation match the game’s expectations (e.g. ship pointing up if the game assumes that). Once integrated, remove any old vector-drawing code for the ship and adjust collision bounds to the sprite’s size. This provides an immediate visual upgrade without altering gameplay. Textured & Detailed Asteroids: Currently asteroids are drawn as white-outlined polygons
GitHub
GitHub
. To make them more detailed and 3D-looking, consider filling those polygon shapes with a stone texture. In HTML5 Canvas, you can create an Image object (e.g. a rocky pattern) and use ctx.createPattern(image, "repeat") to make a fill style
stackoverflow.com
. Then draw the asteroid polygon and call ctx.fill() instead of (or in addition to) ctx.stroke. The texture will fill the shape, and because the canvas context is rotated each frame by the asteroid’s angle
GitHub
GitHub
, the texture will rotate with it, simulating a spinning surface. This approach keeps asteroids procedurally generated (for irregular outlines) but with a consistent rocky appearance. You might still draw a subtle outline or drop the outline for a fully filled look. Adjust the texture’s brightness or color to match the game’s style (e.g. gray rock with slight shading). The result should be asteroids that look less like wireframes and more like solid rocks. Technical tip: ensure the texture image is loaded and ready before drawing; you can initialize the pattern once and reuse it for all asteroids for efficiency. Enhanced Starfield Background: The current starfield is already dense (~2000 stars) with parallax layers and varied brightness
GitHub
. To push it further, you could add twinkling stars or subtle color variation. A simple method is to randomly vary each star’s brightness slightly during each draw cycle
excessivelyadequate.com
, giving a twinkle effect. You can implement this by drawing stars with an alpha that oscillates or with occasional flicker on a random subset of stars. Another enhancement is to include color variety based on star distance – for example, distant stars tinted blue and nearer stars warm white
godotshaders.com
. This mimics how stars can appear different (blue giants vs red dwarfs) and adds depth. Since you already use parallax for depth, you can assign a color or size to each star layer (e.g. far layer stars are smaller and bluish, close layer stars larger and white). The parallax layering can also be increased to 3+ layers, perhaps with an extra layer of a few large, very distant stars that move very slowly
godotshaders.com
. Finally, consider occasional special effects: for instance, a rare “shooting star” streak or a faint nebula cloud in the background. These should be used sparingly to avoid distraction, but can add that “wow” factor. Overall, the goal is to keep the background lively yet not overpowering – small twinkles and color shifts can make the starfield feel more dynamic without drawing attention away from the gameplay.
Upgrade Systems and Game Balance
Upgrade Paths for Wave vs Survival Modes: Designing upgrade systems for the two modes might require different approaches. In Wave Mode (discrete levels of enemies), you can implement a between-wave upgrade or shop. For example, after clearing a wave, present the player with a choice of upgrades or a store where they spend points/currency for enhancements before the next wave begins. This segmented approach lets players recover or retool between waves. In Survival Mode (endless play until death), the upgrades should occur during the run – often via a level-up system. As the player destroys enemies/asteroids, they accumulate XP and periodically “level up,” triggering an upgrade selection. A popular design (seen in Nova Drift and many roguelites) is to offer a choice of 3 random upgrades at each level-up, from which the player picks one. This was described in Nova Drift, an Asteroids-inspired roguelite where “you finish waves of enemies and level up and pick upgrades… then you do it again”
forum.quartertothree.com
. The random choice adds variety and replay value, ensuring each run yields different builds. Implementing this might involve pausing the action momentarily and showing an upgrade menu with 3 cards or icons for the player to choose from. Types of Upgrades & Balance: Start by brainstorming categories of upgrades. Common ones in space shooters include: weapon upgrades (spread shot, faster fire rate, missiles, lasers, etc.), defensive upgrades (shields, more lives or hull integrity, smaller hitbox), mobility upgrades (faster thrust, better handling), and miscellaneous abilities (e.g. periodic shockwaves, drones that assist in combat, etc.). You might also include upgrades that modify existing stats (fire rate, bullet speed, ship speed, damage, etc.). It’s wise to tier them: basic upgrades first, with more powerful or specialized ones appearing later or after certain prerequisites. For example, Nova Drift separates “Gear” (weapon/shield/body choices) from “Mods” (stackable enhancements) and unlocks the latter after a few levels
lordsofgaming.net
lordsofgaming.net
. You don’t need that same complexity initially, but it illustrates how players can first pick a major path (say, weapon type) and then later refine with smaller upgrades. Balancing Upgrade Progression: Balance is crucial so that the game remains challenging but fair. One strategy is to use an XP curve that increases per level – i.e., each new level requires more XP than the last. This prevents the player from leveling up too fast and stacking all upgrades early. As one player noted about a similar asteroids roguelite, if XP requirements don’t scale, “I was leveling up every few seconds once I had a few levels in”
reddit.com
, which made the game too easy. To avoid this, decide how many upgrades you expect a player to get in an average run and tune the XP curve to deliver that. Also scale enemy difficulty in parallel – e.g., each wave or each few levels, introduce tougher enemies or higher asteroid speeds so that upgrades are needed to survive. If Wave mode is meant to have a finite end (say 10 waves and a boss), ensure a player who reaches the end has roughly a full kit of upgrades but not an invincible juggernaut before the finale. In Survival (endless) mode, since the game will eventually overwhelm the player, you can be more generous with upgrades and see how long they last. Playtesting is key – simulate or log how quickly players gain XP and how effective each upgrade is. If one upgrade combo always trivializes the game, you may need to tone it down or increase difficulty accordingly. Roguelite Elements & Permanent Progression: To increase long-term engagement, you can add permanent upgrades or unlocks outside of a single run – e.g. a hangar or tech tree in the main menu. In this system, players earn some currency or points each run (tied to score, distance, or achievements) that persist after death. They can spend these to unlock new ship abilities, weapons, or slight stat boosts that apply to the start of future runs. This is a hallmark of roguelites: “Play, die, upgrade, and repeat” in a cycle
forum.quartertothree.com
. For example, you might let the player permanently increase their starting lives, or unlock entirely new ship types or starting weapons. Nova Drift does this by unlocking new upgrade options over time
forum.quartertothree.com
 – players noticed “upgrades available that weren’t available before” after successive runs, which keeps the game fresh. Another example is Rogue Legacy (a platformer), where gold from runs upgrades your character’s base stats for the next run; in a space shooter, this could be framed as ship improvements or new tech blueprints that persist. When implementing permanent upgrades, balance is again key: they should make the player stronger, but not so overpowered that eventually the game becomes trivial. One approach is diminishing returns (each upgrade costs more, or has smaller effect as it stacks) or introducing higher difficulty levels to tackle once players have many upgrades. In-Run Drops vs Post-Run Upgrades: You mentioned “nanobots that upgrade the ship given whatever options open up when leveling” – this is a flavorful way to explain the in-run upgrade mechanism (e.g. collect a power-up item that triggers the level-up choice). You can have asteroids sometimes drop these “nanobot” upgrade tokens or just have XP be an automatic accumulation. In addition, classic arcade design allows power-up drops: maybe certain destroyed asteroids or enemy UFOs drop temporary power-ups (like a damage boost, a shield recharge, or one-time items). These add moment-to-moment excitement and decision-making (do you risk going for the power-up?). Just be careful not to overwhelm the player with too many different systems; ensure the player can clearly understand when they leveled up and how to choose an upgrade, versus when a temporary pickup appears. Currency Implementation & Use: If you introduce a new currency (for permanent upgrades or for an in-game shop), decide what form it takes and how it’s earned. A common theme is to have ores or minerals drop from asteroids – for example, Space Miner (another Asteroids-like game) uses the concept of mining asteroid ore which converts to money: “Destroy asteroids, collect different minerals to improve your ship”
store.steampowered.com
. You could likewise assign a point value or currency value to each asteroid (perhaps based on size – larger asteroids drop more) and have the player collect it as floating resources. This currency can then be spent either between waves (at a shop or upgrade screen) or between runs (for permanent boosts, as discussed). To implement it, you’d add a currency counter to the HUD and increment it whenever the player collects a resource. Physically, you could spawn a pickup item that the ship must touch, or simply auto-collect to avoid extra hassle in a fast shooter. Balancing currency involves setting prices for upgrades appropriately. Start by determining how many runs or waves you expect a player to play to afford a meaningful upgrade. You want upgrades to feel rewarding and attainable, but not so cheap that the player unlocks everything in one hour. A typical model: early upgrades are cheap so the player gets a taste of progress, then costs ramp up exponentially for the strongest upgrades. Also consider multiple currencies: maybe one currency for the shop during runs (temporary money) and a separate one for permanent upgrades (e.g. “Upgrade Points” earned only on game over, proportional to score or furthest wave). This prevents the player from having to choose between short-term power (using currency now) and long-term progress – they can engage with both systems separately.
UI/UX and Art Direction
HUD and Interface Design: For a fast-paced space shooter, the HUD should be clear, minimal, and out of the action area. Key elements to display are the player’s lives, score, current level/wave, and perhaps shield/health status. Your current layout places score and lives to the side of the play area and a minimap to the right
GitHub
GitHub
 – that’s a good start, as it keeps central vision focused on gameplay. Moving forward, consider adding an XP bar and level indicator (since you’re adding leveling). In the recent update, a top-centered XP bar was added with a numeric readout
GitHub
GitHub
 – this is a good approach, as players can glance at progress towards the next upgrade. Visual hierarchy is important: the most critical info (maybe lives and health) should be the most prominent, whereas stats like score or wave number can be smaller or tucked in a corner. A UI/UX art director’s advice is to list everything you want on the HUD, rank it by importance, and design around those priorities
reddit.com
. In practice, that means maybe your Lives and Shield are larger icons or distinct colors, while the score is smaller text. Also avoid information overload – show only what the player needs at the moment
reddit.com
. For example, if you implement a temporary power-up, you might show an icon and duration only when active, then hide it when not. Keep the HUD lean so that it doesn’t clutter the screen or distract. Upgrade Selection UI: When the player levels up (in survival mode) or between waves, you’ll need a UI for choosing upgrades. Generally, it’s best to pause or slow the game during this to give players time to read choices. You can overlay a semi-transparent panel with 3 upgrade cards/buttons. Each should have a concise title, an icon if possible, and a short description. Maintain a consistent style for these panels – for instance, a futuristic tech border or a simple translucent black box – and use a readable font (sans-serif fonts are usually preferred for legibility in games
reddit.com
). Test the text size by actually viewing it in-game; players shouldn’t have to squint or read paragraphs mid-action. Tooltips or extended info can be available on hover or a “More info” key, but the basic effect should be clear (“+20% fire rate” or “Gain homing missiles”). Visual Style and Cohesion: It’s important that the ship, asteroids, background, and UI all feel like they belong to the same game. Right now you’re transitioning from pure vectors to raster images. Decide on an art direction: will it be retro neon (glowing outlines and particles), pixel art (chunky pixelated ship and asteroids for a classic feel), or a more modern painted look (textured asteroids, high-res ship sprite, etc.)? Each approach can work, but you should unify around one. For example, if the ship PNG is a sleek colored graphic, having asteroids textured similarly (instead of pure white lines) will match it better. Likewise, the starfield colors should complement the overall color scheme (e.g. if the game objects are mostly grayscale with bright highlights, the stars could remain white/blue; if you go neon, the stars might have neon purple/blue glows, etc.). The UI can either be diegetic (styled like in-world holograms) or simply functional. A clean, contrasty UI often works best: e.g. light text on a dark translucent background, or vice versa, so it’s readable at a glance. Use color coding in the UI sparingly but smartly – for instance, you might display lives or health in green (turning red when low), and use a consistent color for XP or currency. One player feedback point for a similar game was to use color to distinguish elements: “bad stuff in the red/orange range, good stuff in blue/green”
reddit.com
. That’s a good rule of thumb: enemy bullets/explosions could have a warm hue, whereas player projectiles or power-ups have cooler hues, so the player can instantly tell if an object is a threat or a reward. Approach to Developing Art Assets: If you’re not an artist, don’t worry – there are resources to help. You can find free or inexpensive asset packs for space games (for example, on sites like itch.io or OpenGameArt, there are asteroid and spaceship sprite packs
