Issues
livesRef uses a hard-coded starting value instead of the INITIAL_LIVES constant
Initializing lives with a literal value makes the game harder to configure and risks inconsistencies with the declared default in UI state and constants file

Suggested task
Use INITIAL_LIVES constant for life tracking

Asteroid initialization logic is duplicated
The code that populates initialAsteroids appears both in the startup effect and in startGame, increasing maintenance cost

Suggested task
Consolidate asteroid initialization

Magic numbers for ship friction
Ship deceleration and friction use literal multipliers (0.92, 0.99), making tuning harder and obscuring intent

Suggested task
Move ship friction multipliers to constants
 
Zoom limits are duplicated and unused
MAX_ZOOM_OUT and MIN_ZOOM are defined but not applied; setZoom instead uses hard-coded 1 and 3

Suggested task
Apply zoom constants in Camera.setZoom
 
MINIMAP_SCALE is defined but never used
Leaving unused constants can confuse developers about intended features

Suggested task
Remove or utilize MINIMAP_SCALE
 
Legacy wrapViewport function is unused
The helper persists despite no references in the codebase, adding noise to collision.js

Suggested task
Remove unused wrapViewport helper

Bullet class stores unused lastX and lastY properties
These fields are updated but never read, implying dead code or incomplete features

Suggested task
Remove unused Bullet position history

UI layout relies on fixed pixel widths/positions
.bottom-ui and .ui-left use absolute pixel values, which hinders responsiveness and ties layout to a specific canvas size

Suggested task
Make UI layout responsive

src/components/Minimap.js lacks a trailing newline
The file ends without a newline, which can trigger lint or version-control warnings

Suggested task
Add trailing newline to Minimap.js

1. Legacy collision helper is unused
wrapViewport in src/utils/collision.js is never referenced, leaving dead code that can confuse maintenance.

Suggested task
Remove unused wrapViewport helper

2. Unused constants clutter the configuration
MAX_ZOOM_OUT, MIN_ZOOM, and MINIMAP_SCALE are defined in src/utils/constants.js but not used anywhere.

Suggested task
Prune or integrate unused constants

3. Zoom bounds hard‑coded instead of using constants
Camera.setZoom clamps zoom with literal values 1 and 3, ignoring the constants meant for this purpose.

Suggested task
Use configurable zoom limits

4. Zoom interpolation factor is a magic number
updateZoom multiplies by 0.1 directly, making the smoothing rate difficult to tune.

Suggested task
Expose zoom lerp factor as constant

5. Lives state uses a literal instead of the existing constant
livesRef is initialized with useRef(3) instead of INITIAL_LIVES, duplicating a value.

Suggested task
Tie livesRef to INITIAL_LIVES
 
6. Bullet class tracks unused coordinates
src/components/Bullet.js stores lastX and lastY, but these fields are never read.

Suggested task
Remove unused bullet history fields

7. Ship friction coefficients are hard‑coded
src/App.jsx multiplies velocity by 0.92 and 0.99, making tuning difficult.

Suggested task
Centralize ship friction values

8. Layout CSS duplicates canvas dimensions
.bottom-ui uses width: 1200px; and .ui-left uses left: 320px;, which repeat canvas-specific numbers.

Suggested task
Remove duplicated layout magic numbers

9. State updates trigger React re-render every frame
setUiState is invoked inside the animation loop, causing React renders at the frame rate.

Suggested task
Throttle UI state updates

10. Bullets wrap around world edges
wrapPosition(bullet) in src/App.jsx causes bullets to reappear on opposite edges, which may be unintended for typical Asteroids mechanics.

Suggested task
Reassess bullet world wrapping

QA & Hygiene Findings
Hardcoded initial lives bypasses shared constant
src/App.jsx initializes livesRef with literal 3, ignoring INITIAL_LIVES from constants.js, which could lead to inconsistent starting lives if the constant changes.

Suggested task
Use INITIAL_LIVES when initializing livesRef

Unused legacy collision helper
wrapViewport in src/utils/collision.js is never imported or invoked, leaving dead code.

Suggested task
Remove unused wrapViewport utility

Unused minimap constant
MINIMAP_SCALE is exported in src/utils/constants.js but not used anywhere.

Suggested task
Eliminate unused MINIMAP_SCALE constant

Bullet class stores unused coordinates
src/components/Bullet.js tracks lastX and lastY without ever reading them.

Suggested task
Drop unused Bullet position history

Render loop captures stale uiState
The render callback in src/App.jsx depends on uiState.isPaused but excludes it from the dependency array, risking stale values.

Suggested task
Include uiState in render callback dependencies

Duplicate ship drawing logic
src/App.jsx manually draws the ship instead of reusing Ship.draw, duplicating rendering logic.

Suggested task
Reuse Ship.draw in main render

Layout relies on hardcoded pixel values
src/App.css uses fixed values like width: 1200px, left: 320px, and margin-top: -30px, which ties UI layout to current canvas size.

Suggested task
Replace hardcoded layout numbers with CSS variables or calculations

Magic numbers for ship friction
The update loop in src/App.jsx multiplies velocity by 0.92 and 0.99, making tuning difficult.

Suggested task
Move ship friction multipliers to constants

Wheel event listener lacks passive flag
document.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheel); in src/App.jsx calls e.preventDefault() but doesn’t specify { passive: false }, potentially causing browser warnings.

Suggested task
Add passive option to wheel listener

Repository lacks license and package metadata
No LICENSE file or license, author, and repository fields in package.json.

Suggested task
Add project licensing and metadata

Missing newline at end of files
Several source files end without a newline (src/components/Minimap.js, src/components/Ship.js, src/utils/camera.js, src/utils/collision.js), which can break tooling.

Suggested task
Ensure newline at EOF for source files

Starfield generation uses unexplained magic multipliers
generateStarfield in src/App.jsx multiplies STAR_COUNT by 3, world dimensions by 1.5, and uses hardcoded parallax range 0.3–0.7.

Suggested task
Parameterize starfield generation constants

Camera zoom easing factor hardcoded
camera.updateZoom in src/utils/camera.js uses a fixed 0.1 interpolation value.

Suggested task
Expose camera zoom smoothing factor as constant

Documentation script references outdated canvas size
src/App.css and comments assume a fixed 1200×900 canvas; if CANVAS_WIDTH or CANVAS_HEIGHT change, styling becomes inconsistent.

Suggested task
Synchronize CSS with canvas dimensions

QA Findings
Starting lives are hard-coded instead of using the shared constant, making configuration brittle if the default number changes in constants.js

Suggested task
Initialize livesRef using INITIAL_LIVES

Zoom limits are hard-coded and ignore existing constants, which can lead to inconsistencies if the limits are updated in one place but not another

Suggested task
Use MIN_ZOOM and MAX_ZOOM_OUT in camera zoom logic

Legacy wrapViewport function is unused, adding dead code to the utility module

Suggested task
Remove unused wrapViewport utility

Bullet objects track lastX and lastY but these fields are never read, increasing memory usage without benefit

Suggested task
Eliminate unused Bullet position history

MINIMAP_SCALE constant is defined but never used, and manual scale calculations appear in the drawing logic instead

Suggested task
Apply MINIMAP_SCALE in minimap rendering

Unused imports MAX_ZOOM_OUT and MIN_ZOOM in App.jsx, cluttering the import list

Suggested task
Clean up unused zoom imports

Layout relies on hard-coded pixel values tied to canvas width, making UI placement fragile if dimensions change

Suggested task
Replace fixed UI dimensions with responsive logic

Physics friction values are magic numbers embedded in update logic, reducing clarity and hindering adjustments

Suggested task
Move friction coefficients to constants

startGame does not reset lastShotTimeRef, potentially allowing immediate rapid firing after a restart

Suggested task
Reset bullet timer on game start

Several source files lack a trailing newline, which can trigger linter warnings and hamper diff clarity (e.g., camera.js, collision.js, Minimap.js)

Suggested task
Ensure files end with newline
