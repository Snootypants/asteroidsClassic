Findings
The responsive layout still relies on hard-coded margins (30 px left/right/top and 150 px bottom), while the HUD/Xp bar spans the window with only 14 px horizontal padding. As a result, the play area remains inset, fails to match the HUD width, and leaves uneven spacing above/below the XP bar instead of starting just above it with matching outer gaps.

1. Define shared CSS custom properties for the HUD’s horizontal padding and total height in `src/styles/theme.css`, and reuse them in `.hudRoot` so the spacing is declared in one place.
2. Update `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js` to read those variables (e.g., via `getComputedStyle(document.documentElement)`) and compute the available width/height so the playfield’s left/right offsets equal the HUD padding, the top margin matches that spacing, and the bottom gap equals the same spacing plus the HUD height to clear the XP bar.
3. Adjust the playfield positioning logic to use the new offsets (removing or overriding any conflicting CSS margins) while still clamping to the aspect ratio.
4. Verify in the browser at multiple viewport sizes that the playfield border lines up with the HUD edges and the gap above the XP bar matches the outer margins.

Issues
The responsive layout logic never lets the playfield stretch to the HUD’s inner edges when the viewport is wide. In updateGameLayout we always size from the available height (lines 26-35) and then horizontally center (line 43), so the left/right padding frequently grows far beyond the top margin. That breaks the requirement that the play area line up with the HUD’s horizontal bounds and that the side spacing match the top gap.


1. Rework `updateGameLayout` in `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js` so the computed playfield width matches the HUD’s inner width (the window width minus the HUD’s horizontal padding) instead of centering a height-constrained rectangle.
2. After choosing that width, derive the playfield height from the aspect ratio and clamp it so it still fits between the top margin and the HUD’s reserved bottom space; if the height has to be clamped, adjust the width again so the aspect ratio is preserved.
3. Set `playX`/`playY` directly from the chosen equal margins so the play area sits immediately above the XP bar with identical top/side spacing.
4. Verify the HUD’s padding (`.hudRoot` in `src/styles/ui.css`) and the updated margins stay in sync across breakpoints.

Findings
The responsive layout still uses hard-coded margins and vertical centering for the playfield (MARGIN_LEFT/RIGHT = 30, MARGIN_BOTTOM = 150, and centering via (availableWidth - playWidth) / 2 and (availableHeight - playHeight) / 2), so the canvas ends up inset farther than the HUD’s 14 px side padding and floats above the XP bar instead of starting immediately above it. Because the HUD remains full-width with only 14 px horizontal padding, the play area does not extend as wide as the HUD, and the extra vertical centering space keeps it from abutting the XP bar as requested.

1. Update `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js` so the play area’s left/right margin matches the HUD’s 14 px padding and the bottom margin is derived from the HUD/XP bar height instead of a fixed `150`.
2. Remove the vertical centering by setting `playY` directly to the top margin and ensure the computed height makes the playfield terminate precisely at the XP bar’s top edge.
3. Keep the aspect-ratio logic intact, but adjust any dependent calculations (e.g., `playWidth`, `playHeight`, and `metaLayout`) so they use the revised margins while still updating the canvas and HUD positions correctly.

Findings
Playfield layout is still centered and aspect-locked, so it never lines up with the HUD footprint
The responsive layout keeps a hard-coded 30 px margin box and centers the playfield inside a fixed 1349:817 aspect ratio. On typical monitors, that makes the playable area hundreds of pixels narrower than the HUD (which spans the viewport with only 14 px padding), and the top gutter stays at 30 px while the side gutters grow, violating the “same spacing above and beside” requirement.

1. In `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js`, replace the hard-coded `MARGIN_*` values with constants that mirror the HUD’s padding (14 px horizontally, whichever top gap you want to keep) and read the reserved bottom space from the HUD height (`--hud-height`).
2. Recompute `playWidth` as `window.innerWidth - 2 * HUD_PADDING` and `playHeight` as `window.innerHeight - HUD_HEIGHT - TOP_SPACING` so the playfield touches the XP bar. Drop the centering math in favour of `playX = HUD_PADDING` and `playY = TOP_SPACING`, then update the canvas and `metaLayout` fields accordingly.
3. Keep the minimap sizing logic in sync with the new `playWidth`/`playHeight`, and smoke-test window resizes to ensure the play area edges stay aligned with the HUD on every breakpoint.

HUD padding prevents the play area from “starting above” the XP bar
The HUD container still has 10 px of top padding and an outdated --hud-height, so even after resizing the playfield there will always be a gap between the playfield border and the XP bar, contrary to the request to have the play area start immediately above it.

1. Edit `.hudRoot` in `src/styles/ui.css` to remove the 10 px top padding (or reduce it to the exact gap you want) and, if needed, set an explicit `height` tied to `var(--hud-height)` so the XP bar sits flush beneath the playfield border.
2. Update the `--hud-height` value in `src/styles/theme.css` to match the new rendered stack height, ensuring the space reserved by `useResponsiveLayout` equals the actual HUD height.
3. Verify in the browser that the XP bar now abuts the play area with no unintended gap while the HUD panels still render correctly.
