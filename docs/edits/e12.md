Findings
The playfield margin logic diverges from the HUD padding. useResponsiveLayout recenters the canvas whenever the height constraint kicks in, bumping playX to MARGIN_HORIZONTAL + extraHorizontalSpace / 2; meanwhile .hudRoot still relies on the original --hud-padding-h value. As a result, the play area’s left/right gaps no longer line up with the HUD’s fixed padding, contradicting the requested layout consistency.

1. In `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js`, keep a single `horizontalMargin` variable that represents the final left/right spacing (after any `extraHorizontalSpace` adjustment), use it for both `playX` and the computed offsets, and stop using a different value when the playfield height is clamped.
2. Immediately after computing that margin, update the shared CSS custom property (e.g., `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--hud-padding-h', \`${horizontalMargin}px\`)\`) so the HUD reads the same spacing value instead of the static default.
3. Ensure `src/styles/theme.css` no longer hardcodes a conflicting `--hud-padding-h`; leave only the dynamic value (with a minimal default fallback if needed) so the HUD and play area stay in sync without duplicate assignments.

Findings
The playfield still recenters itself whenever the available width exceeds the constrained play width. In useResponsiveLayout, the extraHorizontalSpace block offsets playX by half of the remaining gutter, so the play area’s left/right gaps grow beyond the HUD’s 14 px padding on wider displays—the exact mismatch the user asked to eliminate.

1. Open `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js` and find the `extraHorizontalSpace` logic that adjusts `playX`.
2. Remove or update that adjustment so `playX` always equals `MARGIN_HORIZONTAL`, ensuring the playfield’s left/right margins match the HUD padding even when the height clamp reduces the play width.
3. Re-test the layout at multiple window sizes to confirm both left and right gutters line up with the HUD padding while the aspect ratio and other metadata remain intact.

Findings
The responsive layout hook re-centers the playfield whenever the viewport is wider than the computed playfield width (extraHorizontalSpace > 0). This shifts playX away from the HUD’s fixed horizontal padding, so the play area no longer shares the HUD’s 14 px gutters even though both were meant to align

1. Edit `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js` so that the computed `playX` always remains `MARGIN_HORIZONTAL`, even when `availableWidth` exceeds `playWidth`, eliminating the `extraHorizontalSpace` centering logic.
2. Confirm that the HUD still relies on `--hud-padding-h` for its horizontal gutters so the playfield and HUD margins stay synchronized.
3. Manually verify in the browser that varying viewport widths keep both the play area and HUD flush with the same side margins.

Summary
When the viewport is tall enough that the playfield height becomes the limiting factor, useResponsiveLayout widens the horizontal margins beyond the HUD padding by moving playX to hudPaddingH + extra/2, but the HUD still reads the fixed --hud-padding-h value (14px) from theme.css. The result is that the play area sits farther from the window edges than the HUD, contrary to the design request that both margins match.

1. In `src/hooks/useResponsiveLayout.js`, capture the final horizontal margin (the resolved `playX`) after the responsive math and set a CSS custom property (e.g., `--hud-padding-h`) on `document.documentElement` so the HUD can reuse the same spacing.
2. Adjust `src/styles/ui.css` (and `src/styles/theme.css` if necessary) to rely on that dynamic custom property for the HUD’s horizontal padding, removing any stale hard-coded fallback that would reintroduce mismatched spacing.
3. Manually verify on both wide and tall viewports that the playfield frame and HUD share identical gaps to the window edges, updating or adding layout regression coverage if available.
