Summary
App.jsx now wires the live game loop into the new HUD, StartScreen, and GameOverOverlay components from the ui package while loading the shared theme and UI style sheets, matching the e8 design brief.

The new visual language (outer-space backdrop, vignette, HUD layout, modal panels, and buttons) is defined in src/styles/theme.css and src/styles/ui.css, providing the palette, layout primitives, and overlay styling required by e8.md.

Issues
The vignette pseudo-element .outerSpace::after is fixed-position without a negative z-index, so it’s painted after all child nodes of the outerSpace container that houses the canvas and UI. As a result, the semi-opaque black layer ends up covering the playfield and overlays, leaving the game looking like a black screen.

1. Open `src/styles/theme.css` and locate the `.outerSpace` and `.outerSpace::after` rules.
2. Give `.outerSpace` an explicit stacking context (e.g., `z-index: 0`) and assign `.outerSpace::after` a lower `z-index` (such as `-1`) so the vignette renders behind the canvas and HUD instead of on top.
3. Build or run the app to confirm the playfield, menus, and HUD are visible again without the screen appearing solid black.

Summary
The application now imports the redesigned HUD, start menu, and game-over overlays and applies the new theme/UI styles defined in the e8 plan, wiring them into the main render flow of App

The fresh HUD, start screen, and game-over React components live under src/components/ui/, and their supporting styles in src/styles/theme.css and src/styles/ui.css match the layout described in e8.md

Issues
The new layout positions the playfield frame absolutely using the calculated offsets, but the global stylesheet still centers the body as a flex container. With .outerSpace lacking an explicit width, the root collapses and the playfield is rendered off-screen, leaving only the dark background (the observed black screen)

1. In `src/styles/theme.css`, update the `.outerSpace` rule to enforce full viewport width (e.g., add `width: 100vw; min-width: 100vw;`) so the positioned playfield sits within the visible area.
2. Alternatively (or additionally) neutralize the centering flex rules in `src/index.css` if they are no longer needed for the new layout.
3. Run `npm run dev` and verify the game renders in view without the black-screen offset.

Summary
The app now wires in the E8 visual overhaul: App.jsx mounts the new HUD, start menu, and game-over overlay components and applies the shared theme/UI styles, matching the specification from e8.md

Issues
The game crashes during render because formattedTime is passed to useGameSession before it is defined, triggering a runtime “Cannot access 'formattedTime' before initialization” error and yielding a black screen.

1. In `src/App.jsx`, move the `const { start, pause, reset, formattedTime } = useGameTimer();` destructuring (or otherwise obtain `formattedTime`) before the `useGameSession({... formattedTime })` call.
2. Ensure any other references still receive the same values after reordering, then verify the game renders normally.

Run 4. 

The UI refresh from e8.md is in place—the app now uses the new StartScreen, GameOverOverlay, and HUD components together with the accompanying theme/ui styles to deliver the updated presentation.

Issue: formattedTime is passed into useGameSession before useGameTimer() is invoked, so formattedTime is still in its temporal dead zone. This raises a runtime ReferenceError, leaving the React tree unmounted and the screen black.

1. Open `src/App.jsx`.
2. Move the `const { start, pause, reset, formattedTime } = useGameTimer();` destructuring so it executes before the `useGameSession` call, ensuring `formattedTime` is defined before it is passed.
3. Keep the existing `formattedTime` argument on the `useGameSession` call and verify formatting as needed.
4. Rebuild or run the dev server to confirm the game renders without a black screen.
